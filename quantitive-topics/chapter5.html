            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>i. Average Speed</h2>
                <p>Average Speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken to travel
                    that distance.</p>
                <h3>Formula for Average Speed:</h3>
                <p><b>Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time</b></p>

                <p><b>Where:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Total Distance</b> = Sum of all distances traveled</li>
                    <li><b>Total Time</b> = Sum of all times taken</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Points about Average Speed:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average speed does not depend on the speed at each individual point, but on the total distance
                        and total time.</li>
                    <li>If a person travels at different speeds over different distances or times, the average speed is
                        calculated by considering the total distance and total time taken.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>A car travels 100 km at a speed of 50 km/h and then travels another 100 km at a speed of 100 km/h.
                    What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance 1 = 100 km, Speed 1 = 50 km/h, Time 1 = 100 / 50 = 2 hours</li>
                    <li>Distance 2 = 100 km, Speed 2 = 100 km/h, Time 2 = 100 / 100 = 1 hour</li>
                    <li>Total Distance = 100 + 100 = 200 km</li>
                    <li>Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours</li>
                    <li>Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 200 / 3 = 66.67 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 66.67 km/h.</p>

                <h2>ii. Relative Speed</h2>
                <p>Relative Speed refers to the speed of one object with respect to another object. It is useful when
                    two objects are moving in the same or opposite directions.</p>

                <h3>If two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their
                    speeds:</h3>
                <p><b>Relative Speed = Speed of A - Speed of B</b> (where Speed A is the speed of the faster object and
                    Speed B is the speed of the slower object).</p>

                <h3>If two objects are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds:
                </h3>
                <p><b>Relative Speed = Speed of A + Speed of B</b></p>

                <h3>Example 2:</h3>
                <p>Two cars are moving towards each other. Car A moves at 60 km/h and Car B moves at 40 km/h. What is
                    their relative speed?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since the cars are moving towards each other (opposite directions), the relative speed is:</li>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The relative speed is 100 km/h.</p>

                <h3>Example 3:</h3>
                <p>Two trains are moving in the same direction. Train A moves at 80 km/h and Train B moves at 60 km/h.
                    What is their relative speed?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since the trains are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is:</li>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 80 - 60 = 20 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The relative speed is 20 km/h.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Time Taken to Meet (Relative Speed Approach)</h2>
                <p>When two objects move towards each other, the time taken for them to meet can be found using the
                    formula:</p>
                <p><b>Time = Distance between them / Relative Speed</b></p>

                <h3>Example 4:</h3>
                <p>Two cars are 200 km apart and are moving towards each other. Car A moves at 60 km/h and Car B moves
                    at 40 km/h. How long will it take for them to meet?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h</li>
                    <li>Distance between them = 200 km</li>
                    <li>Time = 200 / 100 = 2 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> It will take 2 hours for the cars to meet.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Time Taken to Cross Each Other (Relative Speed Approach)</h2>
                <p>When two objects (e.g., trains, cars) are moving in opposite directions and need to pass each other
                    completely, the time taken for them to cross each other is:</p>
                <p><b>Time to Cross = Sum of the lengths of both objects / Relative Speed</b></p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Example 5:</h3>
                <p>Two trains are 100 meters long each and are moving in opposite directions. Train A moves at 60 km/h
                    and Train B moves at 40 km/h. How much time will they take to cross each other?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convert the speeds into meters per second:
                        <ul>
                            <li>60 km/h = 60 × 1000 / 3600 = 16.67 m/s</li>
                            <li>40 km/h = 40 × 1000 / 3600 = 11.11 m/s</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 16.67 + 11.11 = 27.78 m/s</li>
                    <li>The total length to be covered is 100 + 100 = 200 meters.</li>
                    <li>Time to Cross = 200 / 27.78 ≈ 7.2 seconds</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The trains will take approximately 7.2 seconds to cross each other.</p>

            <h1 id="Boats">2. Boats & Streams Problems</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Boats & Streams problems are a common type of question in competitive exams involving the concept of
                    relative speed in moving objects. These problems usually involve a boat moving in a river, and the
                    stream’s current influences the boat’s motion. These questions test your ability to calculate the
                    effective speed of the boat and how it is affected by the stream's current.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Boat in Still Water:</b> This is the speed of the boat when there is no current
                        in the river. Denoted as <b>B</b> (speed of boat in still water).</li>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Stream (Current):</b> This is the speed at which the water of the stream moves.
                        Denoted as <b>S</b> (speed of stream).</li>
                    <li><b>Effective Speed of the Boat in the Stream:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the boat is moving <b>downstream</b> (in the direction of the current), the current
                            assists the boat, so the effective speed is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water
                            and the speed of the stream: <b>Effective Speed Downstream = B + S</b></li>
                        <li>When the boat is moving <b>upstream</b> (against the current), the current opposes the boat,
                            so the effective speed is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and
                            the speed of the stream: <b>Effective Speed Upstream = B - S</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Boats & Streams Problems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Boat & Stream:</b> These problems usually ask you to calculate the speed of the
                        boat or the stream when the effective speed downstream or upstream is given.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Taken to Travel a Certain Distance:</b> These problems involve calculating the time
                        taken by the boat to cover a certain distance, either downstream or upstream.</li>
                    <li><b>Meeting or Crossing Point:</b> Sometimes, two boats moving in opposite or the same direction
                        are asked to meet or cross each other. The speed of the stream affects their meeting time.</li>

                    boat in still water and the speed of the stream?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p><b>Downstream Speed:</b></p>
                <ul>

                    <li>2B = 18 ⇒ B = 9 km/h</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Substitute <b>B = 9</b> into <b>B + S = 10</b>:</p>

                    <li>9 + S = 10 ⇒ S = 1 km/h</li>

                    <li><b>Time Taken to Cross Each Other:</b> When two trains pass each other, the total distance they
                        cover is the sum of their lengths, and the relative speed (if they are moving in opposite
                        directions) is the sum of their individual speeds. If they are moving in the same direction, the
                        relative speed is the difference of their individual speeds:</li>

                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>A train, 100 meters long, is moving at a speed of 36 km/h. How much time will it take to pass a
                    platform that is 200 meters long?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p><b>Step 1: Convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s:</b></p>
                <pre>36 km/h = (36 × 1000) / 3600 = 10 m/s</pre>

                <p><b>Step 2: Calculate the total distance to be covered:</b></p>
                <pre>Total Distance = 100 m (train length) + 200 m (platform length) = 300 m</pre>

                <p><b>Step 3: Calculate the time taken to pass the platform:</b></p>
                <pre>Time = Total Distance / Speed = 300 m / 10 m/s = 30 seconds</pre>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Circular motion problems and race-related problems are commonly found in competitive exams. These
                    problems typically involve understanding concepts related to the motion of objects along circular
                    paths (like a car on a circular track) or the time it takes for different objects to cover specific
                    distances, such as in races.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Circular Motion Problems</h2>
                <p>Circular motion refers to the motion of an object in a circular path. When objects move in a circle,
                    they are said to undergo uniform circular motion if their speed remains constant. For objects moving
                    in circular paths, key concepts like angular velocity, linear velocity, and centripetal force come
                    into play.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts of Circular Motion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Linear Velocity (Tangential Speed):</b> The speed of an object moving along a circular path,
                        denoted by <b>v</b>. It is the distance traveled per unit time along the circumference of the
                        circle.</li>
                    <pre>v = r * ω</pre>
                    <li><b>Angular Velocity (ω):</b> The rate at which an object moves through an angle in a circular
                        path. It is measured in radians per second (rad/s).</li>
                    <pre>ω = θ / t</pre>
                    <li><b>Centripetal Force:</b> The force that keeps an object moving in a circular path is called the
                        centripetal force. This force is always directed toward the center of the circle.</li>
                    <pre>F = m * v² / r</pre>
                    <li><b>Period of Revolution (T):</b> The time taken for one complete revolution of the object around
                        the circular path.</li>
                    <pre>T = 2πr / v</pre>
                    <li><b>Frequency (f):</b> The number of revolutions completed per unit time. It is the reciprocal of
                        the period.</li>
                    <pre>f = 1 / T</pre>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Circular Motion Problems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Time Taken for One Complete Revolution:</b> These problems involve calculating the time taken
                        for an object to complete one full circle along a circular track or path.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed of an Object in Circular Motion:</b> These problems involve finding the linear speed
                        (tangential speed) or angular velocity of an object moving in a circular path.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>A car is moving along a circular track with a radius of 100 meters. If the car completes one full
                    revolution in 20 seconds, what is the speed of the car?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b> The distance covered in one revolution is the circumference of the circle:</p>
                <pre>Circumference = 2πr = 2π × 100 = 628.31 meters</pre>

                <p><b>Step 2:</b> The time taken for one revolution is 20 seconds.</p>

                <p><b>Step 3:</b> The speed <b>v</b> is the distance divided by the time:</p>
                <pre>v = Circumference / Time = 628.31 / 20 = 31.42 m/s</pre>

                <p><b>Answer:</b> The speed of the car is 31.42 m/s.</p>
