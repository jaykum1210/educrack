            <h1>1. Work, Efficiency, and Wages Problems</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Work, efficiency, and wages problems are commonly found in competitive exams, especially in
                    quantitative reasoning sections. These problems involve concepts of time, work, and the amount of
                    money earned based on the work done.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Work:</h3>
                <p>Work refers to the completion of a task or job. In these problems, the work is generally expressed in
                    terms of the "amount of work" or "units of work."</p>

                <h3>Efficiency:</h3>
                <p>Efficiency refers to how much work a person or machine can complete in a given time. In work-related
                    problems, efficiency is often stated as a fraction of the total work done per unit of time.</p>

                <h3>Time:</h3>
                <p>Time is the duration taken to complete the work. The time taken to complete the work depends on the
                    efficiency of the worker or machine.</p>

                <h3>Wages:</h3>
                <p>Wages refer to the payment for work done. In these problems, wages are generally calculated based on
                    the amount of work completed, and the amount paid is proportional to the work done.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Formulae:</h2>
                <h3>Work-Rate Relationship:</h3>
                <p>If a person completes a work in <b>T</b> days, the work rate of that person is <b>1/T</b> of the
                    total work per day.</p>
                <pre>Work Rate of A = 1 / T<sub>A</sub> work/day</pre>
                <pre>Work Rate of B = 1 / T<sub>B</sub> work/day</pre>

                <h3>Combined Work Rate:</h3>
                <p>When two or more people work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual
                    rates.</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / T<sub>A</sub> + 1 / T<sub>B</sub></pre>

                <h3>Work Formula:</h3>
                <p>Work is the product of rate and time. So, if a person works for <b>t</b> days at a rate of <b>r</b>,
                    the total work done is:</p>
                <pre>Work = r × t</pre>

                <h3>Wages Calculation:</h3>
                <p>Wages are often directly proportional to the work done. If a person completes a fraction <b>1/n</b>
                    of the work, they receive <b>1/n</b> of the total wages. If the total wages for the full work are
                    <b>W</b>, the wage earned for completing <b>1/n</b> of the work is:
                </p>
                <pre>Wages = (Work Done / Total Work) × W</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Problems on Work, Efficiency, and Wages:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Individual Work and Time Problems:</b> Calculate how long it takes for an individual to
                        complete a task based on their efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Combined Work Problems:</b> When multiple workers work together, find the total time taken or
                        total work done.</li>
                    <li><b>Wage Calculation Problems:</b> Calculate the wages earned based on the work done by an
                        individual or a group of workers.</li>
                    <li><b>Work and Time Ratio Problems:</b> These problems require comparing the times taken by
                        different people based on their work rates.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1: Individual Work Time Problem</h3>
                <p>If person A can complete a piece of work in 12 days, and B can complete the same work in 18 days, how
                    long will it take for them to complete the work together?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The rate of work of A is:</p>
                <pre>Rate of A = 1 / 12 work/day</pre>
                <p>The rate of work of B is:</p>
                <pre>Rate of B = 1 / 18 work/day</pre>
                <p>The combined rate of A and B working together is:</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / 12 + 1 / 18 = 5 / 36 work/day</pre>
                <p>The time taken for them to complete the work together is:</p>
                <pre>Time taken = 1 / (5 / 36) = 36 / 5 = 7.2 days</pre>
                <p>So, A and B will complete the work in 7.2 days.</p>

            <h1 id="Pipes">2. Pipes & Cisterns Problems</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Pipes and cisterns problems deal with the filling or emptying of a tank or cistern using pipes with
                    different rates of flow. The key concepts are related to the rates at which water flows into or out
                    of the tank, and the time taken to fill or empty the tank. These problems are often based on the
                    concepts of work, efficiency, and rates.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Filling and Emptying:</h3>
                <p>A pipe filling the cistern is considered to add water to the cistern. A pipe emptying the cistern is
                    considered to remove water from the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Rate of Flow:</h3>
                <p>If a pipe fills the cistern in <b>T</b> hours, its rate of flow is <b>1/T</b> cisterns per hour. If a
                    pipe empties the cistern in <b>T</b> hours, its rate of flow is <b>-1/T</b> cisterns per hour
                    (negative because it's emptying).</p>

                <h3>Combined Rates:</h3>
                <p>When multiple pipes are working together, the total rate of flow is the sum of the individual rates.
                    If a pipe fills the cistern and another empties it, the combined rate is the difference between the
                    filling and emptying rates.</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / T<sub>1</sub> - 1 / T<sub>2</sub></pre>
                <p>Where <b>T<sub>1</sub></b> is the time taken to fill the cistern and <b>T<sub>2</sub></b> is the time
                    taken to empty it.</p>

                <h3>Time Taken:</h3>
                <p>The time taken to fill or empty the cistern is the inverse of the combined rate of the pipes.</p>

                <h2>Formulas:</h2>

                <h3>Filling Rate:</h3>
                <pre>Filling Rate = 1 / T</pre>
                <p>Where <b>T</b> is the time taken to fill the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Emptying Rate:</h3>
                <pre>Emptying Rate = -1 / T</pre>
                <p>Where <b>T</b> is the time taken to empty the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Combined Rate (When pipes are working together):</h3>
                <pre>Combined Rate = Filling Rate + Emptying Rate</pre>
                <p>If the pipes are working against each other, the emptying rate is negative.</p>

                <h3>Time to Fill or Empty:</h3>
                <pre>Time to Fill or Empty = 1 / Combined Rate</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Problems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Filling or Emptying the Cistern:</b> These problems ask how long it takes for a pipe or
                        combination of pipes to fill or empty the cistern.</li>
                    <li><b>Combined Filling and Emptying:</b> These problems involve two or more pipes working together
                        (one filling, one emptying), and the goal is to find the time taken to fill or empty the
                        cistern.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Required When a Pipe is Turned Off:</b> These problems ask for the time it will take to
                        fill the cistern after one pipe has been turned off, or when only one pipe remains open.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1: Filling and Emptying Problem</h3>
                <p>A pipe can fill a cistern in 10 hours, while another pipe can empty the same cistern in 15 hours. How
                    long will it take to fill the cistern if both pipes are open?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The filling rate of the first pipe (filling pipe) is:</p>
                <pre>1 / 10 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The emptying rate of the second pipe (emptying pipe) is:</p>
                <pre>-1 / 15 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The combined rate of both pipes working together is:</p>
                <pre>1 / 10 - 1 / 15 = 3 / 30 - 2 / 30 = 1 / 30 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The time taken to fill the cistern is:</p>
                <pre>Time = 1 / (1 / 30) = 30 hours</pre>
                <p>So, it will take 30 hours to fill the cistern when both pipes are open.</p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Work and time problems are common in quantitative aptitude, and they deal with the amount of work
                    completed over time by individuals or groups of workers, machines, or other entities. The key
                    concepts involve finding the total time taken, the amount of work done, or the rate at which work is
                    completed when multiple workers or entities are involved.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Rate of Work:</h3>
                <p>The rate at which work is completed is typically expressed as "work per unit of time." If a worker
                    completes a job in <b>T</b> hours, their rate of work is <b>1/T</b> of the total work per hour.</p>

                <h3>Total Work:</h3>
                <p>The total amount of work is usually taken as 1 unit (representing the complete task).</p>

                <h3>Combined Work:</h3>
                <p>When two or more people work together, the total rate of work is the sum of their individual rates of
                    work. If they are working on the same task, the combined work rate is the sum of their individual
                    work rates.</p>

                <h3>Time Taken:</h3>
                <p>The time taken to complete the work is the inverse of the combined work rate.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

                <h3>Work Formula:</h3>
                <pre>Work = Rate of Work × Time</pre>

                <h3>Individual Work Rates:</h3>

                    work per hour.</p>

                <h3>Combined Work Rate:</h3>
                <p>When two or more workers work together, the combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / T<sub>1</sub> + 1 / T<sub>2</sub> + …</pre>
                <p>Where <b>T<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>T<sub>2</sub></b>, etc., are the times taken by individuals working
                    separately.</p>

                <h3>Time Taken to Complete the Work Together:</h3>
                <pre>Time Taken = 1 / Combined Rate</pre>

                <p>Work and wages distribution problems are an extension of work and time problems. These problems deal
                    with the distribution of wages among workers based on the amount of work they complete. The basic
                    principle is that workers are paid according to the amount of work they perform, and if multiple
                    workers work together, their wages are distributed based on the amount of work each one does.</p>

                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Rate of Work:</h3>
                <p>The rate of work represents the amount of work completed per unit of time. If a worker completes a
                    task in <b>T</b> days, their rate of work is <b>1/T</b> of the work per day.</p>

                <h3>Total Work:</h3>
                <p>Total work is usually considered as 1 unit of the task or job.</p>

                <h3>Wages Distribution:</h3>
                <p>If the total wages for the task is <b>W</b>, the wages are distributed among the workers based on the
                    proportion of work done by each worker.</p>
                <p>If <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> work together to complete a job, their wages are distributed
                    based on the amount of work each worker contributes.</p>

                <h3>Work Done and Wages:</h3>
                <p>The share of wages for a worker is proportional to the work done by them. If Worker <b>A</b>'s rate
                    of work is <b>1/T<sub>A</sub></b>, Worker <b>B</b>'s rate of work is <b>1/T<sub>B</sub></b>, and
                    Worker <b>C</b>'s rate of work is <b>1/T<sub>C</sub></b>, then the total work done by all workers is
                    1 unit.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Formulae:</h2>

                <h3>Work Done by Each Worker:</h3>
                <p>If the total work is 1 unit, the work done by each worker is based on their rate of work relative to
                    the total rate of work.</p>
                <pre>Work done by Worker A in 1 day = 1 / T<sub>A</sub></pre>
                <pre>Work done by Worker B in 1 day = 1 / T<sub>B</sub></pre>
                <pre>Work done by Worker C in 1 day = 1 / T<sub>C</sub></pre>

                <h3>Total Rate of Work:</h3>
                <pre>Total Rate = 1 / T<sub>A</sub> + 1 / T<sub>B</sub> + 1 / T<sub>C</sub></pre>

                <h3>Wages Distribution:</h3>
                <p>The share of wages for each worker is proportional to the amount of work done by them. If the total
                    wages are <b>W</b>, the wages for each worker will be:</p>
                <pre>Wages for A = W × (1 / T<sub>A</sub>) / Total Rate</pre>
                <pre>Wages for B = W × (1 / T<sub>B</sub>) / Total Rate</pre>
                <pre>Wages for C = W × (1 / T<sub>C</sub>) / Total Rate</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Problems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wages Distribution Among Workers:</b> Given the total wages and the time taken by each
                        worker, calculate how much each worker should be paid based on the work done.</li>
                    <li><b>Wages Distribution Based on Time:</b> In some problems, workers may work for different
                        amounts of time, and their wages are distributed based on the time worked.</li>
                    <li><b>Partial Work Completion:</b> Sometimes, workers may leave before the work is completed, and
                        the wages are distributed based on the amount of work done by each worker until they leave.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1: Wages Distribution Based on Work Done</h3>
                <p>A and B together can complete a task in 6 days. If A can complete the task alone in 8 days, how
                    should the wages of 240 be distributed between A and B?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The rate of work of A is <b>1/8</b> (A completes the task in 8 days).</p>
                <p>The rate of work of A and B together is <b>1/6</b> (A and B together complete the task in 6 days).
                </p>

                <p>The rate of work of B alone is:</p>
                <pre>Rate of B = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24</pre>
                <p>So, B takes 24 days to complete the task alone.</p>

                <p>The work done by A in one day is <b>1/8</b> and the work done by B in one day is <b>1/24</b>.</p>

                <p>The total work rate is:</p>
                <pre>Total Rate = 1/8 + 1/24 = 3/24 + 1/24 = 4/24 = 1/6</pre>

                <p>The share of wages for A is proportional to A's work rate:</p>
                <pre>Wages for A = 240 × (1/8) / (1/6) = 240 × (6/8) = 240 × (3/4) = 180</pre>

                <p>The share of wages for B is proportional to B's work rate:</p>
                <pre>Wages for B = 240 × (1/24) / (1/6) = 240 × (6/24) = 240 × (1/4) = 60</pre>

                <p>So, A should receive 180 and B should receive 60 from the total wages of 240.</p>

            <h1 id="Negative">5. Negative Work & Reverse Work</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>In physics and mathematics, negative work and reverse work refer to situations where the work done by
                    a force is in the opposite direction of the movement of an object or when a worker is effectively
                    reducing the amount of work done. These concepts are essential when analyzing forces acting on
                    objects and understanding how different forces influence the movement or energy of a system.</p>

                <h2>i. Negative Work</h2>
                <p>Negative work occurs when the force applied to an object is in the opposite direction of the object's
                    displacement. When this happens, the object moves in the opposite direction to the force applied,
                    and the work done is considered negative.</p>

                <h3>Concept of Negative Work:</h3>
                <p>Work is calculated as:</p>
                <pre>W = F × d × cos(θ)</pre>
                <p>where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>W</b> is the work done</li>
                    <li><b>F</b> is the magnitude of the force applied</li>
                    <li><b>d</b> is the displacement of the object</li>
                    <li><b>θ</b> is the angle between the force and the displacement vector</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Negative work occurs when <b>θ > 90°</b>. In such cases, the force acts opposite to the direction of
                    displacement, and the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative.</p>

                <h3>Example of Negative Work:</h3>
                <p>If a person is pushing a box to the right, but friction is acting in the opposite direction (to the
                    left), then friction does negative work. The force of friction slows down the box as it moves to the
                    right.</p>
                <p>In this case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The displacement of the box is to the right (positive direction).</li>
                    <li>The force of friction acts to the left (negative direction).</li>
                    <li>The angle between the displacement and force direction is 180°, which makes <b>cos(180°) =
                            -1</b>, so the work done by friction is negative.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mathematical Example:</h3>
                <p>If a box of mass 5 kg is pushed to the right for 10 meters, and the frictional force is 2 N acting
                    opposite to the direction of motion:</p>
                <pre>W = F × d × cos(180°)</pre>
                <pre>W = 2 × 10 × (-1) = -20 Joules</pre>
                <p>The work done by the friction is -20 Joules, indicating that energy is being taken away from the box.
                </p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Reverse Work</h2>
                <p>Reverse work refers to a scenario where the direction of the force applied is reversed after
                    performing positive work. It can occur in situations where a worker or machine begins to reverse the
                    process that was initially done (i.e., reducing the effect of work done earlier).</p>

                <h3>Reverse Work in Human Effort:</h3>
                <p>In the context of human labor, reverse work can be interpreted as situations where a person who was
                    initially performing a task (e.g., lifting or carrying an object) stops the task or does the
                    opposite (e.g., lowering or pushing the object back).</p>

                <h3>Example of Reverse Work:</h3>
                <p>Consider a scenario where you lift a box (positive work) and then lower it (reverse work):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lifting:</b> Work is done in the direction of the applied force (positive work).</li>
                    <li><b>Lowering:</b> Work is done in the opposite direction, and the force is exerted downward to
                        counteract gravity. This results in negative or reverse work.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Work and Energy Concept:</h3>
                <p>In reverse work, energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For instance, lowering a lifted
                    object means the gravitational potential energy is reduced, and the energy is given back to the
                    environment.</p>

                <h3>Mathematical Example:</h3>
                <p>If you lift a box with a force of 50 N for 2 meters, the work done is:</p>
                <pre>W = 50 × 2 = 100 Joules (positive work)</pre>
                <p>If you then lower the box by 2 meters with the same force, the reverse work is:</p>
                <pre>W = 50 × 2 = 100 Joules (negative or reverse work)</pre>
                <p>The reverse work here takes away the energy that was initially imparted to the box by lifting it.</p>

                <h2>Practical Examples of Negative and Reverse Work:</h2>
                <h3>Example 1: Negative Work in a Car Braking:</h3>
                <p>When a car is moving forward, and the brakes are applied, the friction between the tires and the road
                    slows down the car. This is an example of negative work. The car moves in the direction of its
                    velocity, while the frictional force opposes the motion. The brakes are performing negative work by
                    reducing the car’s kinetic energy.</p>
