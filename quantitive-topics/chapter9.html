                <h2> Number Series</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a number series, a sequence of numbers is given, and you need to find the next number or
                        identify the pattern that fits the sequence.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: These are the squares of natural numbers: 1², 2², 3², 4², 5². The next number will be
                        6² = 36.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example 2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The difference between consecutive numbers increases by 2 each time:
                        <ul>
                            <li>6 - 2 = 4</li>
                            <li>12 - 6 = 6</li>
                            <li>20 - 12 = 8</li>
                            <li>30 - 20 = 10</li>
                        </ul>
                        The next difference will be 12, so the next number will be 30 + 12 = 42.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>A, C, E, G, I, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The letters are alternating every two positions in the alphabet: A, C, E, G, I. The
                        next letter will be K.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coding-Decoding is a reasoning technique that involves transforming a given set of numbers,
                        letters, or symbols into codes based on certain rules. The objective is to identify the pattern
                        or logic behind the transformation.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Coding-Decoding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letter Coding</li>
                    <li>Number Coding</li>
                    <li>Symbol Coding</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Letter Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In letter coding, each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter according to a fixed
                        rule. The rule can be based on shifting positions, reversing the alphabet, or other
                        manipulations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Letter Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Shift in Alphabet</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → C, B → D, C → E, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: Each letter is shifted by +2.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → F</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Reverse Alphabet Coding</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → Z, B → Y, C → X, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: Reverse the alphabet.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → W</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Positional Shift</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → 1, B → 2, C → 3, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The letters are replaced by their position numbers.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → 4</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Number Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In number coding, a number is replaced by another number based on some mathematical
                        relationship, which could be addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or powers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Number Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Simple Arithmetic Operations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 3 → 6, 4 → 12, 5 → 20, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is multiplied by its position.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 6 × 5 = 30</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Squares or Cubes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 2 → 4, 3 → 9, 4 → 16, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is squared.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 5 → 25</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Prime Numbers or Factors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 3 → 9, 5 → 25, 7 → 49, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is squared.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 11 → 121</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Symbol Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In symbol coding, special symbols like #, $, %, *, &, etc., are used in place of numbers or
                        letters. The key here is to decode the meaning of each symbol and how they relate to numbers or
                        letters.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Symbol Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Symbols Representing Operations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: # means +, * means -, % means ×.</li>
                    <li>Code: 6 # 3 * 2 % 4 → (6 + 3) - 2 × 4 → 9 - 2 × 4 = 9 - 8 = 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Substitution of Symbols with Numbers or Letters</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: * represents multiplication, % represents division.</li>
                    <li>Code: 5 * 4 % 2 → 5 × 4 ÷ 2 = 20 ÷ 2 = 10.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Common Approaches to Solve Coding-Decoding Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for Arithmetic Patterns: Identify if the numbers or letters are related through addition,
                        subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation.</li>
                    <li>Position and Shifting: Sometimes, positions in the alphabet (or the number line) are key. Look
                        for consistent shifting patterns (e.g., shifting a letter by +2 in the alphabet).</li>
                    <li>Reverse and Symmetry: Some codes might use reverse positions, such as reversing the alphabet or
                        number sequences.</li>
                    <li>Understand Symbol Operations: If symbols are involved, carefully analyze the operation they
                        represent, like +, -, ×, ÷.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>Problem: What is the angle between the hour and minute hands at 3:15?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The hour hand is at 90° (3 × 30° = 90°).</li>
                            <li>At 3:15, the hour hand moves 7.5° further (15 × 0.5°).</li>
                            <li>The minute hand is at 90° (15 × 6°).</li>
                            <li>The angle between them is: |(90° + 7.5°) - 90°| = 7.5°.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Answer: 7.5°.</p>

                        <p>Problem: When do the hour and minute hands overlap between 3:00 and 4:00?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The hour hand is at 90° at 3:00.</li>
                            <li>The minute hand moves faster than the hour hand.</li>
                            <li>The equation for overlap is: 90° + 0.5° × t = 6° × t.</li>
                            <li>Solve for t: 90° = 5.5° × t, so t = 90 ÷ 5.5 = 16.36 minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Answer: The hands overlap at 3:16:22.</p>

                        <p><b>Clock-Based Problem 3: Time When Hands Are 90° Apart</b></p>
                        <p>Problem: When are the hour and minute hands 90° apart between 3:00 and 4:00?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the formula: θ = |30H - 5.5M| and set θ = 90°.</li>
                            <li>Solve for M (minutes) for two different times within the hour when the hands form a 90°
                                angle.</li>
                            <li>The two times when the hands are 90° apart are around 3:16:22 and 3:49:09.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Answer: 3:16:22 and 3:49:09.</p>
