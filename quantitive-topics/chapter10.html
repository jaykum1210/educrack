                <ul>
                    <li>Set Theory deals with the study of sets, which are collections of objects or elements.</li>
                    <li>For example, the set of all natural numbers, the set of all students in a class, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Basic Terminology in Set Theory</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Set:</b> A collection of well-defined objects. For example,
                        A = {1, 2, 3} is a set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Element:</b> An individual object in a set. For example, 1 is an element of the set A = {1,
                        2, 3}.</li>
                    <li><b>Subset:</b> A set where all its elements are also contained in another set. For example,
                        A = {1, 2} is a subset of B = {1, 2, 3}.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Union (A ∪ B):</b> The set of all elements that belong to either set A, set B, or both.</li>
                    <li><b>Intersection (A ∩ B):</b> The set of all elements that belong to both set A and set B.</li>
                    <li><b>Difference (A − B):</b> The set of all elements that belong to A but not to B.</li>
                    <li><b>Complement (Aᶜ):</b> The set of all elements not in A.</li>
                    <li><b>Universal Set (U):</b> The set that contains all possible elements under consideration.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Example of Set Operations</h2>

                    <li><b>Union:</b> A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
                    <li><b>Intersection:</b> A ∩ B = {2, 3}</li>
                    <li><b>Difference:</b> A − B = {1}</li>
                    <li><b>Complement:</b> If the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then Aᶜ = {4, 5}</li>

                <h2>Venn Diagrams</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Venn Diagram is a visual representation of sets and their relationships with each other.</li>
                    <li>It uses overlapping circles to show how sets relate to one another in terms of union,
                        intersection, and difference.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Venn Diagram Components</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Universal Set (U):</b> Represented by a rectangle, it includes all possible elements under
                        consideration.</li>
                    <li><b>Circles:</b> Represent sets within the universal set. Overlapping circles show the
                        intersection of sets.</li>
                    <li><b>Shaded Regions:</b> Used to illustrate operations like union, intersection, and difference.

                <h2>Operations in Venn Diagrams</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Union:</b> The area covered by both sets. If you have two sets A and B, the union is the
                        entire area covered by both circles.</li>
                    <li><b>Intersection:</b> The area where both circles overlap. It shows the common elements between
                        two sets.</li>
                    <li><b>Difference:</b> The area in one circle that does not overlap with the other circle. It shows
                        the elements that belong to one set but not the other.</li>
                    <li><b>Complement:</b> The area outside a circle represents the complement of the set. It includes
                        all elements that do not belong to the set.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples of Venn Diagram Problems</h2>
                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>In a survey, 80 people were asked if they liked tea or coffee. 50 liked tea, 40 liked coffee, and 30
                    liked both tea and coffee. How many liked only tea, only coffee, or both?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>T = Tea lovers</b>, <b>C = Coffee lovers</b></li>
                    <li><b>∣T∣ = 50</b> (Tea lovers)</li>
                    <li><b>∣C∣ = 40</b> (Coffee lovers)</li>
                    <li><b>∣T ∩ C∣ = 30</b> (People who like both)</li>
                    <li>Only Tea = ∣T∣ − ∣T ∩ C∣ = 50 − 30 = 20</li>
                    <li>Only Coffee = ∣C∣ − ∣T ∩ C∣ = 40 − 30 = 10</li>
                    <li>Thus, the final answers are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>20 people like only tea.</li>
                        <li>10 people like only coffee.</li>
                        <li>30 people like both tea and coffee.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Example 2:</h3>
                <p>In a class of 60 students, 40 students like Mathematics, 35 like Physics, and 25 like both
                    Mathematics and Physics. How many students like only one of the subjects?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>M = Students who like Mathematics</b>, <b>P = Students who like Physics</b></li>
                    <li><b>∣M∣ = 40</b></li>
                    <li><b>∣P∣ = 35</b></li>
                    <li><b>∣M ∩ P∣ = 25</b></li>
                    <li>Only Mathematics = ∣M∣ − ∣M ∩ P∣ = 40 − 25 = 15</li>
                    <li>Only Physics = ∣P∣ − ∣M ∩ P∣ = 35 − 25 = 10</li>
                    <li>Thus, the number of students who like only one subject is:</li>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logical deduction refers to the process of drawing conclusions based on given facts, rules, or
                        premises.</li>
                    <li>It is a critical skill in many areas such as mathematics, philosophy, and competitive exams.
                    </li>
                    <li>In logical deduction problems, you are provided with a set of conditions, and your task is to
                        infer the correct relationships or conclusions from those conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Logical Deduction Problems</h2>
                <h3>Syllogism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Syllogism is a type of logical argument where a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed
                        propositions (premises).</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Premise 1:</b> All men are mortal.</li>
                            <li><b>Premise 2:</b> Socrates is a man.</li>
                            <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Socrates is mortal.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <p>Syllogism problems typically involve two premises, and you need to deduce the correct conclusion
                        based on the given facts.</p>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Premise 1:</b> All dogs are animals.</li>
                        <li><b>Premise 2:</b> Fido is a dog.</li>
                        <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Fido is an animal.</li>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b> The conclusion is valid, as it follows from the premises.</li>
                    </ul>

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Puzzle-based Logical Deductions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These puzzles involve a set of conditions that describe relationships between different items or
                        entities. You need to use these conditions to deduce certain facts or answer questions.</li>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <p>There are four friends: A, B, C, and D.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A is taller than B.</li>
                        <li>C is taller than D.</li>
                        <li>B is shorter than D.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Question:</h4>
                    <p>Who is the tallest among the four friends?</p>
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A > B (A is taller than B).</li>

                        <li>B < D (B is shorter than D).</li>
                        <li>Since A is taller than B, and B is shorter than D, we conclude that C is the tallest, as
                            there is no restriction on C's height relative to A.</li>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b> C is the tallest.</li>

                <h3>Direction and Position-based Problems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These problems involve determining someone's location, position, or direction based on a series
                        of statements.</li>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <p>A person walks 10 meters North, turns right, and walks 10 meters again. Then, he turns right and
                        walks 10 meters. In which direction is he from his starting point?</p>
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The person walks 10 meters North.</li>
                        <li>Then, he turns right (East) and walks 10 meters.</li>
                        <li>Finally, he turns right again (South) and walks 10 meters.</li>

                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <p>A woman is looking at a photograph. A person asks her, "Who are you looking at?" The woman
                        replies, "Brothers and sisters, I have none. But the father of the person in the photograph is
                        my father’s son." Who is in the photograph?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Logical deduction can also involve analyzing a statement and inferring whether the assumption
                        based on it is true or false.</li>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The statement is saying that no birds are mammals, which implies that all birds are
                            non-mammals. Thus, the assumption is true.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Read the problem carefully: Understand all the conditions or premises provided.</li>
                    <li>Break down the problem: Identify key facts and relationships that are mentioned.</li>
                    <li>Use process of elimination: In some cases, you can eliminate incorrect options and deduce the
                        correct answer.</li>
                    <li>Draw diagrams if necessary: Sometimes, drawing a Venn diagram, family tree, or chart helps
                        visualize relationships and makes deductions easier.</li>
                    <li>Consider all possibilities: When you’re unsure about a problem, list all possible scenarios and

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Mathematical puzzles and riddles are fun and challenging ways to test your problem-solving skills and
                    enhance your logical thinking. They often require creative thinking and an understanding of basic
                    mathematical concepts. These puzzles can range from simple arithmetic to complex logic-based
                    problems.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Common Types of Mathematical Puzzles and Riddles</h2>
                <h3>1. Classic Number Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 1: The Missing Dollar Riddle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Three friends check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10, and
                    the hotel clerk gives them a $5 discount because of an overcharge. The clerk gives $1 back to each
                    friend and keeps $2 for himself. Now, each friend has paid $9 (totaling $27), and the clerk has kept
                    $2. Where did the extra dollar go?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>This puzzle is often misleading because it suggests a discrepancy in the way the amounts are being
                    added.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The total amount paid is $30.</li>
                    <li>Each friend gets $1 back, so they have paid $9 each, totaling $27.</li>
                    <li>Out of this $27, $25 is for the room, and $2 is kept by the clerk.</li>
                    <li>There is no missing dollar; the confusion comes from adding the $2 (the clerk's tip) to the $27,
                        which is incorrect. The $27 already includes the $2 kept by the clerk.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The riddle plays on a logical error in the way the amounts are added.</p>

                <h3>2. Word-based Mathematical Riddles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 2: The Bridge and Torch Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have one torch, and the bridge can
                    only hold two people at a time. The crossing times are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Person 1: 1 minute</li>
                    <li>Person 2: 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Person 3: 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Person 4: 10 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The torch must be walked back each time, and two people can cross together, but they must move at the
                    slower person's pace. What is the shortest time in which all four people can cross the bridge?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>First crossing: Person 1 and Person 2 cross together (2 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Return: Person 1 goes back with the torch (1 minute).</li>
                    <li>Second crossing: Person 3 and Person 4 cross together (10 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Return: Person 2 goes back with the torch (2 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Final crossing: Person 1 and Person 2 cross together again (2 minutes).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The shortest time is 17 minutes.</p>

                <h3>3. Logic-based Mathematical Riddles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 3: The Two Sons Riddle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> A man is looking at a picture of someone. His friend asks, “Who are you looking at?”
                    The man replies, “Brothers and sisters, I have none. But the father of the person in the picture is
                    my father’s son.” Who is in the picture?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The man says, "The father of the person in the picture is my father’s son."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the man has no brothers, "my father’s son" must refer to himself.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, the person in the picture is his son.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The person in the picture is his son.</p>

                <h3>4. Age-related Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 4: The Age Difference Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> A father is 30 years older than his son. In 10 years, the father will be three times
                    as old as the son. How old are the father and the son?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>Let the son's age be <i>x</i>. Then the father's age is <i>x + 30</i>.</p>
                <p>In 10 years, the son will be <i>x + 10</i>, and the father will be <i>x + 40</i>.</p>
                <p>According to the problem, in 10 years, the father will be three times the son's age:</p>
                <p><i>x + 40 = 3(x + 10)</i></p>
                <p>Simplifying:</p>
                <p><i>x + 40 = 3x + 30</i></p>
                <p><i>40 - 30 = 3x - x</i></p>
                <p><i>10 = 2x</i></p>
                <p><i>x = 5</i></p>
                <p>So, the son is 5 years old, and the father is <i>5 + 30 = 35</i> years old.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The son is 5 years old, and the father is 35 years old.</p>

                <h3>5. Pattern and Sequence Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 5: The Number Sequence</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, __?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The numbers are perfect squares:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>1<sup>2</sup> = 1</i></li>
                    <li><i>2<sup>2</sup> = 4</i></li>
                    <li><i>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</i></li>
                    <li><i>4<sup>2</sup> = 16</i></li>
                    <li><i>5<sup>2</sup> = 25</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The next number in the sequence will be <i>6<sup>2</sup> = 36</i>.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The next number is 36.</p>

                <h3>6. Coin-related Puzzle</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 6: The Weighing Puzzle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> You have 12 identical-looking coins. One of them is either heavier or lighter than
                    the others. You have a balance scale and can only use it three times. How do you find the odd coin
                    and determine whether it is heavier or lighter?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the 12 coins into three groups of 4 coins each.</li>
                    <li>Weigh two groups (Group A and Group B). There are three possible outcomes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If they balance, the odd coin is in Group C.</li>
                            <li>If Group A is heavier or lighter, the odd coin is in Group A or Group B.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now take the 4 coins from the group that contains the odd coin and divide them into three coins
                        and one coin.</li>
                    <li>Weigh the three coins against each other:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If they balance, the odd coin is the one not weighed, and you can determine whether it
                                is heavier or lighter.</li>
                            <li>If they do not balance, you will know which coin is the odd one and whether it is
                                heavier or lighter.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> This method will find the odd coin and determine if it is heavier or lighter in three
                    weighings.</p>

                <h3>7. Logical Deduction Puzzle</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 7: The Light Bulb Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> You are in a room with three switches, each controlling one of three light bulbs in
                    another room. You can’t see the bulbs from where the switches are, and you can only enter the room
                    with the bulbs once. How do you determine which switch controls which bulb?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn on the first switch and leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>After a few minutes, turn off the first switch and turn on the second switch.</li>
                    <li>Now, enter the room with the bulbs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch.</li>
                            <li>The bulb that is off and warm corresponds to the first switch (since it was on for a
                                while and then turned off).</li>
                            <li>The bulb that is off and cold corresponds to the third switch.</li>
                        </ul>
