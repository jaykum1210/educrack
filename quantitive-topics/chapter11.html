                <ul>
                    <li>A ratio is a way of comparing two or more quantities, showing the relative size of two values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formula: The ratio of two quantities <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is written as:</li>
                    <p><b>Ratio = a/b or a : b</b></p>
                    <li><b>Example 1:</b> If there are 3 apples and 2 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is:</li>
                    <p><b>Ratio = 3/2 or 3 : 2</b></p>
                    <li><b>Example 2:</b> The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:5, meaning for every 4 boys, there
                        are 5 girls in the class.</li>

                <h3>Steps for Alligation Alternate:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Write the concentration or price of the two components (substances) you are mixing.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Find the desired or mean concentration/price of the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Subtract the mean value from the concentration/price of each of the substances.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: The differences you obtain are the parts in which the two substances must be mixed.</li>

                <h4>Formula for Alligation Alternate:</h4>
                <p>If two components with concentrations <i>C₁</i> and <i>C₂</i> are mixed to get a mixture with
                    concentration <i>Cₘ</i>, the ratio of mixing is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Alligation Mean is used when the mean (average) value of a mixture is required, based on the
                        concentrations and the quantities of each substance.</li>

                <h2>Mean (Arithmetic Mean)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mean (or average) of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then
                        dividing the sum by the total number of values in the set.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Formula for Arithmetic Mean:</h4>
                <p><b>Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)</b></p>

                <p>For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, 7, and 9:</p>
                <p><b>Mean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6</b></p>

                <h2>Weighted Average</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A weighted average is used when some values in a dataset are more important or have more
                        significance than others. Instead of each value contributing equally to the average, each value
                        is multiplied by a weight that reflects its importance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Formula for Weighted Average:</h4>
                <p><b>Weighted Average = (x₁ × w₁) + (x₂ × w₂) + ... + (xₙ × wₙ) / (w₁ + w₂ + ... + wₙ)</b></p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ</i> are the values.</li>
                    <li><i>w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ</i> are the corresponding weights.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The sum of the weights is the total weight, and the formula computes the average considering these
                    weights.</p>

                        <p><b>Example 1: Simple Weighted Average</b></p>
                        <p><b>Problem:</b> A student has the following grades for different subjects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Math: 80 (weight 2)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Find the weighted average of the grades.</p>

                        <p><b>Solution:</b> Using the formula for weighted average:</p>
                        <p><b>Weighted Average = (80 × 2 + 90 × 3 + 85 × 1) / (2 + 3 + 1)</b></p>
                        <p>Weighted Average = (160 + 270 + 85) / 6 = 515 / 6 ≈ 85.83</p>

                        <p><b>Solution:</b> Using the weighted average formula:</p>
                        <p>Price of A = ₹20, Quantity of A = 300</p>
                        <p>Price of B = ₹15, Quantity of B = 500</p>
                        <p><b>Weighted Average Price = (20 × 300 + 15 × 500) / (300 + 500)</b></p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Partnership</h2>
                <p>In a partnership, two or more individuals or entities come together to run a business, share profits,
                    and bear the losses according to a mutually agreed ratio. The agreement usually specifies how
                    profits, losses, and capital will be divided among the partners.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts in Partnership</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Capital Contribution:</b> This refers to the amount of money or assets each partner invests
                        in the business. The partnership ratio (profit-sharing ratio) is often based on the amount of
                        capital invested.</li>
                    <li><b>Profit Sharing Ratio:</b> The ratio in which the partners will share the profits (or losses)
                        of the business. This can be based on their capital contribution or some other agreement.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Factor:</b> If the partners invest their capital for different periods, the time factor
                        is considered while calculating the profit-sharing ratio. The effective contribution of each
                        partner is their capital multiplied by the time for which it is invested.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Formula for Partnership</h3>
                <p>If the capital contributions of two partners <b>P₁</b> and <b>P₂</b> for different time periods
                    <b>T₁</b> and <b>T₂</b> are known, then the share of profits can be calculated using the following
                    formula:
                </p>

                <p><b>Profit of Partner 1 = (P₁ × T₁) / (P₁ × T₁ + P₂ × T₂) × Total Profit</b></p>
                <p><b>Profit of Partner 2 = (P₂ × T₂) / (P₁ × T₁ + P₂ × T₂) × Total Profit</b></p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>P₁</b> and <b>P₂</b> are the amounts of capital invested by Partner 1 and Partner 2,
                        respectively.</li>
                    <li><b>T₁</b> and <b>T₂</b> are the time periods for which the capital is invested.</li>
                    <li><b>Total Profit</b> is the total amount of profit or loss made by the business.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Types of Partnership</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fixed Capital Partnership:</b> In this type of partnership, the capital contribution of the
                        partners remains constant throughout the business period.</li>
                    <li><b>Fluctuating Capital Partnership:</b> Here, the capital contribution of the partners may
                        change during the course of the business, i.e., the partners can add or withdraw capital as per
                        their needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Investments</h2>
                <p>An investment involves putting money or capital into a business or asset with the expectation of
                    receiving a return or profit over time. In partnerships, the initial investment and any subsequent
                    additions to it determine the profit-sharing ratio among the partners.</p>

                <h3>Key Terms in Investments</h3>

                    <li><b>Time Period (T):</b> The duration for which the investment is made.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Simple Interest (SI)</h3>
                <p>The interest earned on the principal over a period of time, calculated using the formula:</p>
                <p><b>SI = (P × R × T) / 100</b></p>

                <h3>Compound Interest (CI)</h3>
                <p>Interest that is calculated on both the principal and the accumulated interest. The formula for
                    compound interest is:</p>
                <p><b>A = P(1 + R / 100)^T</b></p>
