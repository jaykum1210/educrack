                <ul>
                    <li>These concepts are widely used in business, commerce, and financial transactions. They deal with
                        how much money is made or lost on a transaction, and how much a discount reduces the original
                        price of an item.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Profit</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Profit is the positive difference between the selling price and the cost price. When the selling
                        price is greater than the cost price, the seller earns a profit.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Profit:
                        <p>Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Selling Price (SP): The price at which an item is sold.</li>
                    <li>Cost Price (CP): The price at which an item is bought or the cost to produce it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Profit Percentage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To calculate profit percentage, use the formula:
                        <p>Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the cost price of a product is $500, and it is sold for $600, the profit is:
                        <p>Profit = 600 - 500 = 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The profit percentage is:
                        <p>Profit Percentage = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Loss</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss occurs when the selling price is less than the cost price. In this case, the seller sells
                        the product at a price lower than what was paid for it, resulting in a loss.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Loss:
                        <p>Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Loss Percentage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To calculate the loss percentage, use the formula:
                        <p>Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the cost price of a product is $500, and it is sold for $400, the loss is:
                        <p>Loss = 500 - 400 = 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The loss percentage is:
                        <p>Loss Percentage = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Discount</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discount is the reduction in the selling price of an item, usually given as a percentage of the
                        original price. It is commonly offered during sales or promotions to encourage customers to buy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formula for Discount:
                        <p>Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) × Marked Price (MP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Marked Price (MP): The original price of the item before any discount is applied.</li>
                    <li>Discount Percentage: The percentage of the discount offered.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Selling Price After Discount</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To find the selling price after the discount is applied, subtract the discount from the marked
                        price:
                        <p>Selling Price (SP) = Marked Price (MP) - Discount</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the marked price of a product is $1000 and a 20% discount is offered, the discount
                        amount is:
                        <p>Discount = (20 / 100) × 1000 = 200</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The selling price after discount is:
                        <p>Selling Price = 1000 - 200 = 800</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Profit or Loss on Discounted Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In some cases, an item might be sold at a discount, but you want to know if there is still a
                        profit or loss. This can happen when the cost price is different from the discounted selling
                        price.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Profit or Loss with Discount:
                        <p>Profit or Loss = Selling Price after Discount - Cost Price</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the result is positive, it’s a profit. If the result is negative, it’s a loss.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the cost price of a product is $700, the marked price is $1000, and a 30% discount is
                        offered, then:
                        <p>Discount = (30 / 100) × 1000 = 300</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The selling price after discount is:
                        <p>Selling Price = 1000 - 300 = 700</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The profit or loss is:
                        <p>Profit or Loss = 700 - 700 = 0</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>In this case, there is no profit or loss (break-even).</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the return on investment for lending money. It is
                        usually calculated as a percentage of the principal (the initial amount of money) over a
                        specified period of time. The two main types of interest are Simple Interest and Compound
                        Interest.</li>

                <h2>Explanation with Example</h2>
                <h3>Example 1: Two Successive Percentage Increases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose a product's price increases by 10% in the first year and 15% in the second year. To find
                        the overall percentage increase over the two years:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Change: 10% increase
                            <p>1 + 10 / 100 = 1.10</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Second Change: 15% increase
                            <p>1 + 15 / 100 = 1.15</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Now, calculate the overall percentage change:
                        <p>Overall Percentage Change = (1.10 × 1.15 - 1) × 100 = (1.265 - 1) × 100 = 0.265 × 100 = 26.5%
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the overall percentage increase is 26.5%.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example 2: Successive Percentage Increase and Decrease</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now, consider a price increase of 20% followed by a price decrease of 10%. The formula works as
                        follows:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Change: 20% increase
                            <p>1 + 20 / 100 = 1.20</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Second Change: 10% decrease
                            <p>1 - 10 / 100 = 0.90</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Now calculate the overall percentage change:
                        <p>Overall Percentage Change = (1.20 × 0.90 - 1) × 100 = (1.08 - 1) × 100 = 0.08 × 100 = 8%</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the overall percentage change is an 8% increase.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Adding Percentages Doesn’t Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It might seem intuitive to just add the percentages (for example, 10% + 15% = 25%), but this
                        approach doesn’t take into account the compounding effect, where the second change is applied to
                        the new value after the first change. This is why successive percentage changes must be
                        calculated using the formula rather than simply adding the percentages together.</li>

                    <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> Successive percentage changes are commonly used in retail

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the context of business, retail, and pricing, Marked Price and Selling Price are two key
                        terms used to describe the price of an item. Understanding the relationship between these prices
                        is important for calculating discounts, profits, and losses.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Marked Price (MP)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Marked Price is the original price that is listed or displayed on an item before any
                        discount or reduction is applied. It is the price at which a seller initially offers a product
                        for sale. This price is also sometimes referred to as the List Price or Sticker Price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marked Price</strong></p> = The price tagged on the product. The Marked Price is usually
                        higher
                        than the Selling Price to allow for discounts and profit margins.</li>
                    <li>Example: A shirt is marked with a price tag of $500. This is the Marked Price.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

                <h2>ii. Selling Price (SP)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Selling Price is the actual price at which a product is sold to the customer after any
                        discount or reduction has been applied to the Marked Price. It can either be lower than or equal
                        to the Marked Price, depending on whether there is a discount or if the item is being sold at
                        full price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selling Price</strong> = Marked Price - Discount</li>
                    <li>Example: If the shirt with a Marked Price of $500 is offered with a 20% discount, the Selling
                        Price would be:
                        <p><strong>Selling Price (SP)</strong> = 500 − (20 / 100 × 500) = 500 − 100 = 400</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the Selling Price after discount is $400.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Relationship Between Marked Price, Selling Price, and Discount</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Selling Price (SP) is always related to the Marked Price (MP) through the Discount. The
                        formula is:
                        <p><strong>Selling Price</strong> = Marked Price − Discount</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Alternatively, if you know the Discount Percentage (D%), you can calculate the Discount as:
                        <p><strong>Discount</strong> = (Discount Percentage / 100) × Marked Price</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Profit and Loss with Marked Price and Selling Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profit:</strong> If the Selling Price is greater than the Cost Price (CP), a profit is
                        made. Profit is the difference between the Selling Price and the Cost Price:
                        <p><strong>Profit</strong> = Selling Price (SP) − Cost Price (CP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Loss:</strong> If the Selling Price is less than the Cost Price, a loss occurs. Loss is
                        the difference between the Cost Price and the Selling Price:
                        <p><strong>Loss</strong> = Cost Price (CP) − Selling Price (SP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Profit or Loss Percentage:</strong> You can also calculate the profit percentage or loss
                        percentage based on the Cost Price:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Profit Percentage</strong> = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss Percentage</strong> = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>v. Applications of Marked Price and Selling Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retail and Discounting:</strong> The most common use of Marked Price and Selling Price
                        is in retail, where stores offer discounts on the Marked Price to attract customers, thereby
                        selling at a Selling Price that is lower than the marked or original price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> Businesses set the Marked Price to determine how much they
                        want to sell the product for and allow flexibility for offering discounts during promotions or
                        clearance sales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit Calculation:</strong> Sellers often calculate their Profit by comparing the
                        Selling Price with the Cost Price, which helps in determining the financial success of the
                        transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Shopping:</strong> Consumers often compare the Marked Price and the Selling
                        Price to assess the value of discounts or deals offered by retailers.</li>
                </ul>
