                <li><b>Mens Rea:</b> The mental state or intention to commit a crime. Example: To be convicted of
                    murder, the defendant must have had mens rea, the intent to kill.</li>
                <li><b>Audi Alteram Partem:</b> “Hear the other side” – The principle of fairness, ensuring that both
                    parties are heard. Example: A judge must follow audi alteram partem before making a final decision.
                </li>
                <li><b>Nemo Judex in Causa Sua:</b> No one should be a judge in their own case. Example: The rule of law
                    requires impartiality, meaning nemo judex in causa sua.</li>
                <li><b>Caveat Emptor:</b> “Let the buyer beware” – The buyer is responsible for checking the quality of
                    goods before purchase. Example: Caveat emptor applies in many consumer transactions, especially in
                    real estate.</li>
                <li><b>Stare Decisis:</b> “Stand by things decided” – The principle that courts should follow precedents
                    set by previous cases. Example: Courts adhere to stare decisis to ensure consistency in legal
                    rulings.</li>
                <li><b>Volenti Non Fit Injuria:</b> “To a willing person, no harm is done” – If someone consents to an
                    action, they cannot claim injury from it. Example: In sports, players cannot sue for injuries caused
                    by actions they voluntarily accepted, as per volenti non fit injuria.</li>
                <li><b>Ignorantia Juris Non Excusat:</b> “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Example: Ignorantia juris
                    non excusat means individuals must be aware of the laws they are expected to follow.</li>

                    before a court to determine if their detention is lawful. Example: The prisoner filed a habeas

                <li><b>Pacta Sunt Servanda:</b> “Agreements must be kept” – Legal contracts must be honored. Example:
                    Pacta sunt servanda ensures that once parties enter into a contract, they must fulfill their
                    obligations.</li>
                <li><b>Lex Loci:</b> “The law of the place” – The law that governs a legal issue based on its location.
                    Example: Lex loci dictates that the law of the jurisdiction where a contract is signed governs
                    disputes.</li>

                    they imply negligence without further evidence. Example: In cases of medical malpractice, res ipsa
                    loquitur can apply if the injury is something that doesn’t happen without negligence.</li>
                <li><b>Mala Fide:</b> “In bad faith” – Actions done with dishonest intent. Example: A contract signed
                    mala fide cannot be enforced because it was entered into with fraudulent intentions.</li>
                <li><b>Bona Fide:</b> “In good faith” – Acting with honesty, integrity, and sincerity. Example: The

                <li><b>Fiat Justitia Ruat Caelum:</b> “Let justice be done though the heavens fall” – Justice should
                    prevail, no matter the consequences. Example: Fiat justitia ruat caelum emphasizes that justice
                    should not be compromised by external pressures.</li>
                <li><b>Qui Facit Per Alium Facit Per Se:</b> “He who acts through another, acts himself” – A person who
                    acts through an agent is considered to have acted themselves. Example: A corporation can be held
                    liable for the actions of its employees under qui facit per alium facit per se.</li>
                <li><b>Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium:</b> “Where there is a right, there is a remedy” – The law provides a remedy
                    for every violation of a legal right. Example: If someone’s legal rights are infringed upon, ubi jus
                    ibi remedium ensures that they have a remedy to seek justice.</li>
                <li><b>Noscitur a Sociis:</b> “A word is known by the company it keeps” – A word is understood by the
                    context of surrounding words. Example: Noscitur a sociis helps interpret ambiguous terms in a legal
                    document by considering surrounding terms.</li>
                <li><b>Ex Post Facto:</b> “From a thing done afterward” – A law that retroactively changes the legal
                    consequences of actions. Example: Ex post facto laws are generally prohibited as they punish actions
                    that were legal when committed.</li>
                <li><b>Ad Hoc:</b> “For this purpose” – A solution or committee formed for a specific purpose or
                    problem. Example: The company set up an ad hoc committee to resolve the issue of intellectual

                        <p>Legal passages often present a problem, analysis, and conclusion or ruling. Identify these
                            parts
                            to get a clear understanding of the case or legal concept being discussed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Answer the Questions Based on Passage:</b>
                        <p>When answering questions, always refer to the passage for your answer. Avoid assumptions or

                <h2>Example Legal Comprehension Passage:</h2>
                <p><b>Passage:</b><br>
                    In the case of Smith v. Jones (2017), the plaintiff, Mr. Smith, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Jones
                    for
                    breach of contract. The agreement between the two parties was signed on January 1, 2016, wherein Mr.
                    Jones agreed to deliver a batch of goods to Mr. Smith by March 1, 2016. However, Mr. Jones failed to
                    deliver the goods on the agreed date without any prior notification or valid reason.<br><br>
                    The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the failure to deliver the goods within the
                    specified period amounted to a breach of contract. The court applied the principle of pacta sunt
                    servanda, meaning agreements must be kept, and held Mr. Jones liable for damages. It was noted that
                    the
                    plaintiff had suffered financial loss due to the delayed delivery of goods, and the defendant did
                    not
                    provide any valid defense to justify the delay.<br><br>
                    The court awarded Mr. Smith compensation for the financial damages he incurred due to the
                    non-performance of the contract. The ruling emphasized that contracts are legally binding, and the
                    party
                    failing to perform its obligations without a valid reason must compensate the other party.</p>

            <h1 id="">4. Interpretation of Statutes</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The interpretation of statutes is the process through which courts determine the meaning of the law
                    in
                    relation to specific cases. It involves the application of rules and principles to interpret the
                    language and intent of legislation, ensuring that statutes are applied in a way that achieves the
                    purpose they were created for.</p>

                <h2>Types of Interpretation:</h2>

                <h3>1. Literal Interpretation (Plain Meaning Rule):</h3>
                <p>This approach involves interpreting the statute according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the
                    words
                    used.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If a statute uses the word "dog," it will be interpreted to mean a canine animal,
                    unless
                    there is a legal definition stating otherwise.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> Courts focus on the clear, unambiguous language of the statute and apply it as
                    written.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Purposive Interpretation:</h3>
                <p>The court looks beyond the literal meaning to understand the intent behind the statute. The purpose
                    of
                    the law is considered in order to give effect to its true spirit.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If a statute is intended to protect consumers, courts may interpret certain
                    provisions in
                    a way that maximizes consumer protection, even if the literal wording is ambiguous.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> The court seeks to give effect to the legislative intent rather than strictly
                    adhering
                    to the words of the statute.</p>

                <h3>3. Golden Rule:</h3>
                <p>This is an extension of the literal rule. If applying the literal meaning leads to an absurd or
                    unjust
                    result, the court may modify the interpretation to avoid the result.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If a law states that all vehicles must stop at a red light and includes "airplanes"
                    in
                    the definition of vehicles, applying the literal rule might cause absurdity. Courts may interpret it
                    to
                    exclude airplanes from this requirement.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> Courts modify the literal interpretation when it leads to an absurd or unreasonable
                    result.</p>

                <h3>4. Mischief Rule:</h3>
                <p>This rule looks at the "mischief" (or problem) that the statute was meant to address. The court then
                    interprets the statute in a way that remedies that specific mischief.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> A statute aimed at curbing illegal gambling may be interpreted broadly to include
                    newer
                    forms of online gambling that were not specifically mentioned.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> The interpretation should be in line with the problem the statute was designed to
                    remedy.</p>

                <h3>5. Statutory Context (Contextual Interpretation):</h3>
                <p>This involves interpreting a provision in light of the statute as a whole, considering its context,
                    structure, and the purpose of the law.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> A specific term in a statute might have a particular meaning within a certain section
                    or
                    context that might differ in another section. Courts consider the statute as a whole before
                    interpreting
                    any part.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> Interpretation should take the entire statute into account, not just the isolated
                    provision.</p>

                <h3>6. Ejusdem Generis (Of the Same Kind):</h3>
                <p>This rule applies when a general term follows specific terms in a statute. The general term is
                    interpreted to include only things of the same kind as the specific terms.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If a statute refers to "cars, buses, trucks, and other vehicles," the term "other
                    vehicles" will likely be interpreted to refer to vehicles similar to cars, buses, and trucks, like
                    motorcycles or vans.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> General terms are confined to the same class or category as the specific terms
                    preceding them.</p>

                <h3>7. Noscitur a Sociis (A Word is Known by the Company It Keeps):</h3>
                <p>This rule suggests that words are interpreted based on their context within a statute. A word is
                    understood better when considered with surrounding words.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The word "property" in a statute may be interpreted differently depending on whether
                    it
                    appears alongside terms like "real estate" or "goods."</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> The meaning of a word can be clarified by the words surrounding it.</p>

                <h3>8. Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius (The Expression of One Thing Excludes Others):</h3>
                <p>When a statute specifically mentions certain things, other things that are not mentioned are presumed
                    to
                    be excluded.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If a law allows for "motor vehicles and bicycles" to park in a particular area, it is
                    implied that other vehicles, like motorcycles, are not allowed.</p>
                <p><b>Principle:</b> The explicit inclusion of certain things excludes others from the scope of the
                    statute.
                </p>

                <h2>Rules for Statutory Interpretation:</h2>

                <h3>1. The Rule of Lenity:</h3>
                <p>If a statute is ambiguous and there is a choice between two reasonable interpretations, the court
                    will
                    interpret it in favor of the accused, especially in criminal law.</p>

                <h3>2. The Presumption Against Retroactive Effect:</h3>
                <p>A statute is presumed not to apply to past events unless it explicitly states otherwise.</p>

                <h3>3. Legal Maxims:</h3>
                <p>Various legal maxims, such as in pari materia (in the same matter) and ut res magis valeat quam
                    pereat
                    (that the matter should have effect rather than perish), help guide statutory interpretation.</p>

                <h3>4. Role of Precedent (Stare Decisis):</h3>
                <p>Courts often rely on judicial precedents, where previous interpretations of a statute guide future
                    decisions.</p>
