                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>Parts of speech are the basic building blocks of a sentence in English. They are categories into
                    which words are classified based on their function and meaning. Each part of speech serves a
                    specific role in constructing a sentence, making communication clear and meaningful.</p>

            <h1 id="Subject">2. Subject-Verb Agreement</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>Subject-verb agreement refers to the grammatical rule that the verb in a sentence must agree in
                    number (singular or plural) with its subject. In simpler terms, if the subject is singular, the verb
                    must also be singular; if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Rules of Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>

                <h3>Singular Subject = Singular Verb</h3>
                <p>If the subject is singular, the verb must be in its singular form.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The dog runs quickly.</p>

                <h3>Plural Subject = Plural Verb</h3>
                <p>If the subject is plural, the verb must be in its plural form.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The dogs run quickly.</p>

                <h3>Subjects Joined by "and" Take a Plural Verb</h3>
                <p>When two or more singular subjects are joined by "and," they take a plural verb.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> John and Mary are going to the market.</p>

                <h3>When "or" or "nor" Joins Subjects, the Verb Agrees with the Subject Closest to It</h3>
                <p>If two subjects are joined by "or" or "nor," the verb agrees with the subject that is closer to it.
                </p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Neither the teacher nor the students were present.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Neither the students nor the teacher was present.</p>

                <h3>Collective Nouns Take Singular or Plural Verbs Depending on Context</h3>
                <p>Collective nouns (e.g., team, family, class) can take either singular or plural verbs, depending on
                    whether the group is acting as a unit (singular) or as individuals (plural).</p>
                <p><b>Example (singular):</b> The team is winning the game.</p>
                <p><b>Example (plural):</b> The team are arguing among themselves.</p>

                <h3>Indefinite Pronouns Take Singular Verbs</h3>
                <p>Indefinite pronouns like anyone, everyone, someone, nobody, etc., take singular verbs.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Everyone loves chocolate.</p>

                <h3>When the Subject Is an Uncountable Noun, Use a Singular Verb</h3>
                <p>Uncountable nouns, such as information, money, and water, are always treated as singular.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The information is useful.</p>

                <h3>With "There Is" and "There Are," the Verb Agrees with the Subject That Follows</h3>
                <p>If the subject following "there is" or "there are" is singular, use "is." If it is plural, use "are."
                </p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> There is a book on the table.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> There are books on the table.</p>

                <h3>Some Nouns That Appear Plural in Form but Are Singular in Meaning Take a Singular Verb</h3>
                <p>Certain nouns that look plural but refer to a single entity take a singular verb (e.g., mathematics,
                    news, economics).</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Mathematics is my favorite subject.</p>

                <h3>Expressions of Time, Money, Distance, and Weight Often Take a Singular Verb</h3>
                <p>These expressions, even if they refer to multiple things, are treated as singular because they are
                    seen as a unit.</p>
                <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
                <ul>

                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>Tenses are grammatical structures that indicate the time of an action or state of being. They tell us
                    when something happens: in the past, present, or future. In English, there are three main tenses
                    (past, present, and future), each of which can be divided into four aspects (simple, continuous,
                    perfect, and perfect continuous).</p>

            <div class="topic-description">

                <p>Modifiers and parallelism are crucial elements of grammar that help improve the clarity, style, and

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>1. Modifiers</h2>
                <p>Modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses that provide additional information about other elements in
                    a sentence. They describe, limit, or qualify the meaning of a noun, verb, or adjective.</p>
                <p>Modifiers are mainly divided into adjectives and adverbs, but they can also be phrases or clauses
                    that act to modify a sentence.</p>

                <h3>Types of Modifiers:</h3>
                <h4>Adjectives</h4>
                <p>Adjectives modify nouns or pronouns.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The green car is mine. (Here, "green" is an adjective modifying the noun "car.")</p>

                <h4>Adverbs</h4>
                <p>Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> She ran quickly to catch the bus. (Here, "quickly" modifies the verb "ran.")</p>

                <h4>Phrases as Modifiers:</h4>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The man with the blue hat is my uncle. (Here, the phrase "with the blue hat" modifies
                    the noun "man.")</p>

                <h4>Clauses as Modifiers:</h4>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The book that you gave me is on the table. (Here, the relative clause "that you gave
                    me" modifies the noun "book.")</p>

                <h3>Placement of Modifiers:</h3>
                <h4>Misplaced Modifiers:</h4>
                <p>A modifier should be placed next to the word it is intended to modify. If placed incorrectly, it can
                    create confusion or change the intended meaning.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> She almost drove the car for an hour. (This suggests that she almost drove, but
                    didnâ€™t drive at all.)</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> She drove the car for almost an hour. (This clarifies that she drove the car for
                    nearly an hour.)</p>

                <h4>Squinting Modifiers:</h4>
                <p>These modifiers can cause ambiguity because they might modify the word that comes before or after
                    them.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> I almost drove for an hour. (It is unclear whether the driving lasted almost an
                    hour, or she almost drove for an hour.)</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> I drove for almost an hour. (Clearer meaning: she drove for a duration that lasted
                    nearly an hour.)</p>

                <h2>2. Parallelism</h2>
                <p>Parallelism refers to the use of consistent grammatical structures when listing multiple elements in
                    a sentence. It ensures that elements of equal importance are presented in a grammatically similar
                    way, which improves readability and clarity.</p>

                <h3>Types of Parallelism:</h3>
                <h4>Parallelism in Lists:</h4>
                <p>When listing items, each element should follow the same grammatical structure.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> She likes to swim, biking, and to run. (This is inconsistent.)</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> She likes swimming, biking, and running. (The elements of the list follow the same
                    grammatical structure: gerund forms.)</p>

                <h4>Parallelism in Comparisons:</h4>
                <p>When comparing two or more things, they should be presented in parallel structure.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> She is taller than him and smarter than his brother. (Inconsistent structure: "him"
                    is an object, and "his brother" is a possessive noun.)</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> She is taller than he is and smarter than his brother. (Both parts of the comparison
                    follow a consistent grammatical structure.)</p>

                <h4>Parallelism with Correlative Conjunctions:</h4>
                <p>When using correlative conjunctions (e.g., not only... but also, either... or, neither... nor),
                    ensure the structures on both sides are parallel.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> She is not only a great teacher, but also teaching a new subject. (Inconsistent: "a
                    great teacher" vs. "teaching a new subject.")</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> She is not only a great teacher but also an inspiring mentor. (Parallel structure:
                    both elements are nouns.)</p>

                <h4>Parallelism in Verb Tenses:</h4>
                <p>If actions or events are in the same time frame, they should be presented in the same verb tense.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> He likes running and to play soccer. (Inconsistent verb structure.)</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> He likes running and playing soccer. (Both actions are presented in the same form.)
                </p>

                <h3>Benefits of Modifiers and Parallelism:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Clarity:</b> Proper modifiers give more precise meaning to a sentence, helping readers
                        understand exactly what is being described.</li>
                    <li><b>Style:</b> Parallel structure makes sentences smoother and more elegant, creating a rhythm in
                        writing thatâ€™s easier to follow.</li>
                    <li><b>Conciseness:</b> Parallelism avoids redundancy, and correct modifier placement prevents
                        confusion.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>The team worked tirelessly to complete the project. (The adverb "tirelessly" modifies the verb

                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h3>
                <h4>Misplaced Modifiers:</h4>
                <p>Ensure that modifiers are placed next to the word they are meant to modify.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> Running quickly, the finish line was crossed by the athlete.</p>
                <p><b>Correct:</b> Running quickly, the athlete crossed the finish line.</p>

                <h4>Lack of Parallelism:</h4>
                <p>Always use the same grammatical structure when listing or comparing things.</p>
                <p><b>Incorrect:</b> I like to dance, singing, and play the guitar.</p>

            <h1 id="Active">5. Active & Passive Voice</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">

                <p>Voice in grammar refers to the relationship between the subject and the action of a sentence. In
                    English, there are two main voices: active voice and passive voice.</p>

                <h2>Activ
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">e Voice
                </h2>
                <p>In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action.</p>

                <h3>Structure:</h3>
                <p><b>Subject + Verb + Object</b></p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The dog (subject) chased (verb) the cat (object).</p>

                <h3>Usage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active voice is more direct and often used for clarity and simplicity.</li>
                    <li>It emphasizes the doer (subject) of the action.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Passive Voice</h2>
                <p>In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. The object of the active
                    sentence becomes the subject in the passive sentence.</p>

                <h3>Structure:</h3>
                <p><b>Subject + form of "be" + past participle of verb + (by + agent)</b></p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The cat (subject) was chased (verb) by the dog (agent).</p>

                <h3>Usage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passive voice is used when the focus is on the action or the recipient of the action rather than
                        the doer.</li>
                    <li>It's common in formal writing, scientific reports, and when the doer of the action is unknown or
                        irrelevant.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Transformation between Active and Passive Voice</h2>
                <p>To change a sentence from active to passive:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the subject, verb, and object.</li>
                    <li>Move the object to the subject position.</li>
                    <li>Change the verb to a form of "be" (depending on the tense) + past participle.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, mention the doer of the action (agent) using "by."</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Active:</b> The teacher (subject) explains (verb) the lesson (object).</li>
                    <li><b>Passive:</b> The lesson (subject) is explained (verb) by the teacher (agent).</li>
                    <li><b>Active:</b> She (subject) wrote (verb) the letter (object).</li>
                    <li><b>Passive:</b> The letter (subject) was written (verb) by her (agent).</li>
                    <li><b>Active:</b> They (subject) have completed (verb) the project (object).</li>
                    <li><b>Passive:</b> The project (subject) has been completed (verb) by them (agent).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>When to Use Passive Voice</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Unknown Doer:</b> When the agent (doer) is unknown or irrelevant.
                        <br>The documents were lost. (We donâ€™t know who lost them.)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Focus on the Action or Receiver:</b> When the emphasis is on the action or the recipient of
                        the action.
                        <br>The new law was passed last week. (Focus is on the law, not the lawmakers.)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Formal or Scientific Writing:</b> Passive voice is often used in scientific, technical, or
                        formal writing where the focus is on the action.
                        <br>The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions.

                <h2>2. Indirect Speech</h2>
                <p>In indirect speech (also known as reported speech), the words spoken by the person are not quoted
                    directly. Instead, they are reported or paraphrased. The tense, pronouns, and other words may change
                    depending on the context.</p>

                <h3>Structure:</h3>
                <p><b>Reporting Verb + (that) + Subject + Verb (Paraphrased statement)</b></p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> She said (that) she was going to the market.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The exact words are not quoted.</li>
                    <li>The reporting verb (e.g., said, told, asked) is used.</li>
                    <li>The word "that" is often used (though it is optional in informal speech).</li>
                    <li>Changes are made to tense, pronouns, and time expressions.</li>
