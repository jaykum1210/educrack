            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>statement</b> is a declarative sentence that presents an idea, claim, or assertion. It can
                        be true or false, but it does not contain any presumption or assumption that is not explicitly
                        stated.</li>
                    <li>An <b>assumption</b> is an unstated belief, presumption, or underlying idea that is taken for
                        granted by the speaker or writer to make their argument or statement work.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Statement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A statement clearly expresses an opinion, idea, or fact.</li>
                    <li>It can be based on fact (e.g., "The sun rises in the east") or an opinion (e.g., "I believe this
                        policy will improve the economy").</li>
                    <li>Statements are clear, direct, and unambiguous.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Examples of a Statement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The school will remain closed tomorrow due to a holiday."</li>
                    <li>"The company has increased its profits by 15% this quarter."</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Assumption</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An assumption is an unstated belief, presumption, or idea that is necessary to support a claim
                        or argument.</li>
                    <li>Assumptions are implicit and not directly mentioned but are crucial for the conclusion or
                        statement to hold true.</li>
                    <li>They are often not backed by evidence and may or may not be true.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Examples of an Assumption</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statement: "The company will increase its revenue by launching a new product next month."
                        <p>Assumption: "The market demand for the new product will be high."</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>The Relationship Between Statement & Assumption</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statements are explicit and verifiable, while assumptions are implicit and often unverified.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assumptions provide the necessary foundation for the statement or conclusion. Without the
                        assumption, the statement may not hold true.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example of Statement and Assumption Relationship</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statement: "Students will perform better if they study in groups."
                        <p>Assumption: "Studying in groups improves understanding and retention of information."</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Identifying Assumptions in Arguments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the Statement: Understand what the speaker or writer is claiming or proposing.</li>
                    <li>Consider What Needs to Be True: Think about what conditions must be true for the statement to
                        hold.</li>
                    <li>Look for Unstated Beliefs: Identify beliefs or presuppositions that the author is implicitly
                        relying on to make their argument.</li>
                    <li>Question the Validity: Challenge the assumptions to check if the argument is valid. If the
                        assumption is false or unrealistic, the argument might weaken.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Examples of Statements & Assumptions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statement: "If it rains tomorrow, the match will be postponed."
                        <p>Assumption: "Rain is the only factor that can cause the match to be postponed."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Statement: "The company's stock price will rise if they launch a new product."
                        <p>Assumption: "The new product will be well received by customers and lead to increased sales."
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Statement: "The government should increase funding for education."
                        <p>Assumption: "Increasing funding will improve the quality of education."</p>
                    </li>

                <h2>Example Question with Answer Analysis</h2>
                <p><b>Question:</b><br>
                    Statement: "There has been a significant increase in the number of students failing in a particular
                    subject at a school." <br>
                    Which of the following is the best course of action?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A) Call a meeting of all teachers and discuss the reasons behind this trend.</li>
                    <li>B) Improve the syllabus and teaching methods for the subject.</li>
                    <li>C) Hold extra classes for students who are struggling in that subject.</li>
                    <li>D) Provide counseling to the students who are failing in the subject.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Answer Analysis:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Option A:</b> While meeting and discussing the issue is a good idea, it does not immediately
                        address the problem. It might be the first step, but it isn't an immediate course of action.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Option B:</b> Improving the syllabus and teaching methods can help in the long term but may
                        not address the immediate problem of student failure.</li>
                    <li><b>Option C:</b> Holding extra classes for struggling students is a direct and practical action
                        that targets the immediate issue. It helps students improve in the subject.</li>
                    <li><b>Option D:</b> Providing counseling can help students with emotional or personal problems but
                        doesn't directly address the academic failure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Correct Answer:</b> C) Hold extra classes for students who are struggling in that subject.</p>

                    <li><b>Chronological Sequence:</b> The cause typically precedes the effect in time. The cause
                        happens first, followed by the effect.</li>
                    <li><b>Causality:</b> The relationship is causal — one event directly influences or results in the
                        other.</li>

                <h2>Identifying Cause & Effect</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify the Event:</b> Start by identifying the event or action that seems to have triggered
                        the outcome (cause).</li>
                    <li><b>Look for Consequences:</b> Look for the effect or result that happens because of the event or
                        action.</li>
                    <li><b>Evaluate the Relationship:</b> Ensure that the relationship between the cause and effect is
                        logical and direct.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <p><b>Cause:</b> The factory was shut down for maintenance.<br>
                    <b>Effect:</b> The production line stopped for two days.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, the cause (factory shutdown for maintenance) directly led to the effect (production
                    halting for two days).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Direct Cause & Effect:</b> The cause leads directly to the effect, without any intervening
                        factors.<br>
                        <i>Example:</i> The heavy rain caused flooding in the streets.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Indirect Cause & Effect:</b> The cause indirectly influences the effect, possibly through
                        multiple intermediate steps.<br>
                        <i>Example:</i> The increase in fuel prices caused transportation costs to rise, which
                        eventually led to higher prices for goods.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Immediate Cause & Effect:</b> The cause and effect are closely related in time.<br>
                        <i>Example:</i> The sudden temperature drop caused the pipes to freeze overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Long-Term Cause & Effect:</b> The cause leads to an effect over a longer period.<br>
                        <i>Example:</i> Lack of exercise over the years caused the person to develop heart disease.

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>1. Analogies in Reasoning</h2>
                <p>An analogy is a comparison between two things that are alike in some way, often used to explain or
                    clarify a concept. In reasoning, analogies typically involve finding relationships between pairs of
                    words, phrases, or concepts, and applying the same relationship to a different pair.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Key Characteristics of Analogies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Relationship-Based:</b> Analogies work by establishing a relationship between two pairs of
                        items. If you can identify the relationship between the first pair, you can apply it to find the
                        second pair.</li>
                    <li><b>Logical Comparison:</b> Analogies help in understanding a concept by comparing it to
                        something familiar.</li>
                    <li><b>Structured Format:</b> Typically, analogies are presented in the form of two pairs, such as
                        “A is to B as C is to D.”</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of Analogies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Verbal Analogies:</b> These analogies deal with the relationship between words.
                        <p>Example: Bird is to Flight as Fish is to Swim. The relationship here is that a bird flies,
                            and a fish swims. Both are associated with their respective actions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Mathematical Analogies:</b> These involve relationships between numbers or mathematical
                        operations.
                        <p>Example: 2:4 as 3:6. The relationship is that 4 is double of 2, and similarly, 6 is double of
                            3.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Logical Analogies:</b> These involve logical relationships or patterns.
                        <p>Example: Day is to Night as Sun is to Moon. The relationship is that day contrasts with
                            night, just as the sun contrasts with the moon.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Solving Analogies:</h3>
                <p>To solve analogies, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify the Relationship:</b> Focus on the first pair and determine the type of relationship
                        between the elements (e.g., cause and effect, part-to-whole, synonym, antonym).</li>
                    <li><b>Apply the Relationship:</b> Use the same relationship to find the appropriate connection in
                        the second pair.</li>
                    <li><b>Check for Consistency:</b> Make sure the relationship is consistent in both pairs.</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> A) Sea<br>

                <h2>2. Logical Sequences in Reasoning</h2>
                <p>A logical sequence is a series of events or numbers that follow a particular pattern. Identifying the
                    correct sequence is a common type of question in reasoning tests. These sequences can involve
                    numbers, shapes, letters, or events that follow a predictable order.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics of Logical Sequences:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> The core skill required is recognizing the pattern that governs the
                        sequence.</li>
                    <li><b>Predicting the Next Element:</b> Once the pattern is identified, the task is to predict what
                        comes next in the series.</li>
                    <li><b>Variety of Sequences:</b> Logical sequences can involve arithmetic progressions, geometric
                        progressions, alphabet patterns, or visual patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Logical Sequences:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Number Sequences:</b> These sequences follow a mathematical or numerical pattern.
                        <p>Example: 2, 4, 6, 8, ?. The pattern is increasing by 2. The next number is 10.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Alphabet Sequences:</b> These sequences follow a pattern based on letters or the order of the
                        alphabet.
                        <p>Example: A, C, E, G, ?. The pattern is skipping one letter in between. The next letter is I.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Visual Sequences:</b> These involve shapes or figures that follow a particular visual
                        pattern.
                        <p>Example: If a sequence of shapes alternates between a square and a circle, the next shape
                            would likely be a square.</p>

                <h3>Solving Logical Sequences:</h3>
                <p>To solve logical sequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify the Pattern:</b> Look for a consistent progression or rule that governs the
                        sequence. It could be based on addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or even a
                        logical or visual pattern.</li>
                    <li><b>Determine the Rule:</b> After identifying the pattern, deduce the rule governing the sequence
                        (e.g., arithmetic progression, geometric progression, alphabetical order).</li>
                    <li><b>Predict the Next Item:</b> Apply the rule to determine what comes next in the sequence.</li>

                <p><b>Answer:</b> B) 243<br>
                    <i>Explanation:</i> The pattern is multiplying each term by 3 (3 × 3 = 9, 9 × 3 = 27, 27 × 3 = 81,
                    81 × 3 = 243).

                        A) 20<br>
                        B) 25<br>
                        C) 30<br>
                        D) 18<br>
                        <b>Answer:</b> B) 25<br>
                        <i>Explanation:</i> The pattern is square numbers: 1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16. The next
                        number is 5² = 25.

                        D) L<br>
                        <b>Answer:</b> L<br>
                        <i>Explanation:</i> The pattern increases the position of each letter by 1, 2, 3, 4, so the next
                        letter should be L (A → C → F → J → L).
