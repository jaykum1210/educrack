                <h2>i. Natural Disasters</h2>
                <p>Natural disasters occur due to natural processes of the Earth and can result in significant
                    environmental, human, and economic losses.</p>

                <h3>a. Geological Disasters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Earthquakes</b>: Sudden shaking of the Earth's surface due to the movement of tectonic
                        plates. They can cause widespread damage to infrastructure and loss of life.</li>
                    <li><b>Volcanic Eruptions</b>: Eruptions of molten rock, ash, and gases from volcanoes. They can
                        lead to lava flows, ash fall, pyroclastic flows, and widespread devastation.</li>
                    <li><b>Landslides</b>: The downward movement of rock, soil, and debris on a slope, usually caused by
                        heavy rainfall or earthquakes. Landslides can bury homes, roads, and agricultural land.</li>
                    <li><b>Tsunamis</b>: Large ocean waves generated by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or
                        landslides. They can flood coastal areas and cause widespread destruction.</li>

                    reduce the impact of disasters on human life, property, and the environment. Preparedness refers to
                    the actions taken before a disaster to plan and equip individuals, communities, and organizations to
                    respond effectively, while mitigation focuses on reducing or preventing the potential impacts of
                    disasters.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Disaster Preparedness</h2>
                <p>Disaster preparedness involves planning, training, and organizing resources to ensure a rapid and
                    effective response during an emergency. The goal is to minimize loss of life, property damage, and
                    economic disruption by being well-prepared before the disaster occurs.</p>

                <h3>a. Preparedness Plans</h3>
                <ul>
