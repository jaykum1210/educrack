            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ethics is the branch of philosophy that involves studying what is right and wrong, good and bad,
                        moral and immoral.</li>
                    <li>Ethical theories can be categorized into:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Normative Ethics</b>: Seeks to define moral standards.</li>
                            <li><b>Applied Ethics</b>: Addresses specific moral issues.</li>
                            <li><b>Meta-ethics</b>: Questions the nature and meaning of ethical concepts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Consequentialism</h2>
                <p>Consequentialism is the ethical theory that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes
                    or
                    consequences. The most well-known form of consequentialism is Utilitarianism.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)</b>: The founder of Utilitarianism, Bentham argued that the right
                        action is the one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number. He proposed the
                        <b>hedonistic calculus</b>, a method of measuring pleasure and pain to assess the moral value of
                        actions.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)</b>: A follower of Bentham, Mill refined utilitarianism by
                        introducing the idea of qualitative differences in pleasures. He argued that intellectual and
                        moral
                        pleasures are of higher quality than physical pleasures.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Greatest Happiness Principle</b>: The idea that actions are morally right if they promote the
                        greatest happiness and minimize suffering.</li>
                    <li><b>Hedonism</b>: The belief that pleasure or happiness is the highest good.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Deontology</h2>
                <p>Deontology is the ethical theory that focuses on the morality of actions themselves, rather than
                    their
                    consequences. Certain actions are morally obligatory, regardless of the outcomes.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</b>: The central figure in deontological ethics, Kant argued that
                        moral
                        actions are those performed in accordance with duty, guided by rational principles. Kant’s
                        <b>Categorical Imperative</b> is a key concept, stating that one should act only according to
                        maxims
                        that can be universally applied.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Duty-based Ethics</b>: Ethics that are based on the inherent nature of actions, not their
                        results.</li>
                    <li><b>Moral Law</b>: Kant believed there is a moral law accessible through reason, and individuals
                        must
                        act in accordance with it, regardless of personal desires or consequences.</li>
                    <li><b>Categorical Imperative</b>: An imperative that applies universally, irrespective of desires
                        or
                        consequences. It involves acting in a way that one would want others to act in similar
                        circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Virtue Ethics</h2>
                <p>Virtue Ethics focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than on the rightness or wrongness
                    of
                    individual actions. A person’s moral character and virtues guide them to make morally correct
                    decisions.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Aristotle (384-322 BCE)</b>: One of the founders of virtue ethics, Aristotle emphasized the
                        development of virtuous character traits (like courage, honesty, and wisdom) to lead a
                        flourishing
                        life (eudaimonia). He believed that moral virtue lies in finding the <b>Golden Mean</b>, the
                        balance
                        between deficiency and excess.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Eudaimonia</b>: Often translated as “flourishing” or “well-being,” it is the ultimate goal of
                        life in Aristotle’s virtue ethics, attained through the cultivation of virtues.</li>
                    <li><b>Golden Mean</b>: The virtuous path lies between extremes (e.g., courage is the mean between
                        recklessness and cowardice).</li>
                    <li><b>Character and Virtue</b>: Focuses on developing good character traits that enable individuals
                        to
                        live virtuous lives.</li>
                    <li><b>Moral Education</b>: Virtue ethics emphasizes the role of education and practice in
                        cultivating
                        virtues.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Care Ethics</h2>
                <p>Care Ethics focuses on the moral importance of relationships, care, and empathy. It emphasizes the
                    interdependence of individuals and the importance of caring for others in an ethical context.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Carol Gilligan (1936-)</b>: A leading figure in care ethics, Gilligan criticized traditional
                        ethical theories for being overly abstract and impersonal. She argued that ethics should be
                        based on
                        the nurturing of relationships and the care for others, particularly in the context of women’s
                        moral
                        development.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ethics of Care</b>: The idea that moral decisions should be guided by empathy, compassion,
                        and
                        the context of human relationships, rather than by abstract rules or consequences.</li>
                    <li><b>Relational Ethics</b>: Focuses on the moral significance of human relationships and caring
                        interactions.</li>
                    <li><b>Empathy and Compassion</b>: The ethical importance of understanding and responding to others’
                        needs with care and concern.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Social Contract Theory</h2>
                <p>Social Contract Theory argues that morality arises from an implicit contract among individuals to
                    form a
                    society that benefits all. People consent to the rules and laws of society in exchange for
                    protection
                    and the benefit of living in an organized community.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)</b>: In "Leviathan", Hobbes argued that without a governing
                        authority,
                        life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” People enter into a social contract
                        to
                        establish a government that ensures peace and security.</li>
                    <li><b>John Locke (1632-1704)</b>: Locke’s version of the social contract emphasizes the protection
                        of
                        natural rights (life, liberty, and property). Unlike Hobbes, Locke believed the government’s
                        primary
                        role is to protect individual freedoms.</li>
                    <li><b>Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)</b>: Rousseau argued that individuals must give up some
                        freedoms to the collective general will for the common good. He emphasized direct democracy and
                        community in moral decision-making.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Consent</b>: The idea that individuals agree to the social contract to establish a just
                        society.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Rights and Justice</b>: The protection of individual rights and the distribution of justice
                        in a
                        society governed by moral rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vi. Ethical Egoism</h2>
                <p>Ethical Egoism is the theory that individuals should act in their own self-interest. According to
                    this
                    theory, actions are morally right if they promote one's own best interests.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ayn Rand (1905-1982)</b>: A proponent of Objectivism, Rand argued that rational self-interest
                        and
                        the pursuit of one's own happiness are the highest moral goals. She believed that altruism
                        (self-sacrifice for others) is immoral.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Self-interest</b>: The ethical justification for actions that benefit the individual, even at
                        the
                        expense of others.</li>
                    <li><b>Altruism</b>: Ethical egoism opposes altruism, which suggests individuals have a moral
                        obligation
                        to prioritize the welfare of others.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vii. Relativism</h2>
                <p>Relativism is the belief that ethical principles are not universal but shaped by cultural, societal,
                    or
                    individual factors. There are several forms of relativism, including cultural relativism and ethical
                    relativism.</p>
                <h3>Key Thinkers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Franz Boas (1858-1942)</b>: In anthropology, Boas argued that moral codes and ethical norms
                        vary
                        from culture to culture and should be understood in their own context.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cultural Context</b>: Moral values are shaped by cultural norms and beliefs, and no universal
                        ethical standard exists.</li>
                    <li><b>Tolerance</b>: Ethical relativism encourages tolerance for differing cultural and moral
                        practices.</li>
