                <p><b>Implementation:</b> The BNS came into effect on July 1, 2024, replacing the Indian Penal Code
                    (IPC)
                    that had been in use since 1860.</p>

                <h3>Key Changes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>New Offenses:</b> Introduced categories such as organized crime, terrorism, and acts

                <h1>Recent International Legal Discussions</h1>

                <h2>i. Potential Breach of International Law by UK's Proposed AI Copyright Changes</h2>

                <p><b>Proposal:</b> The UK government plans to modify copyright laws to allow AI companies to use
                    copyrighted materials without permission, unless creators opt out.</p>

                <h3>Legal Concerns:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This approach may violate international agreements such as the World Trade Organization's
                        conventions and the Berne Convention, which protect creators' rights.</li>
                    <li>Legal experts warn of possible judicial reviews and retaliatory measures if the changes are
                        implemented.</li>

                <h3>Industry Impact:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Countries are reluctant to implement stringent environmental regulations due to fears of costly
                        lawsuits from corporations under the ISDS system.</li>

                    <li>Nations like Romania, Italy, and Mexico have faced significant payouts or threats due to
                        decisions
                        affecting fossil fuel and mining projects.</li>
                    <li>The prospect of billion-dollar lawsuits is causing a "regulatory chill," deterring governments
                        from
                        enforcing robust climate policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Financial Speculation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hedge funds and investors are profiting by funding ISDS cases against environmental laws,
                        raising
                        concerns about the integrity and cost of the system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Call for Reform:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experts advocate for reforms to prevent frivolous litigation and protect governments' rights to
                        regulate in the public interest without fear of disproportionate legal repercussions.</li>
