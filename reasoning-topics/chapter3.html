            <h1>1. Seating Arrangements (Linear, Circular, Square) in Analytical Reasoning</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Seating arrangement problems are a common topic in reasoning and logical puzzles. These problems
                    involve figuring out how people or objects can be arranged in a specific seating format. The seating
                    arrangements can be classified into three main types: linear seating, circular seating, and square
                    seating. Each type requires specific techniques for determining the arrangement.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Linear Seating Arrangement</h2>
                <p>In a linear seating arrangement, individuals or objects are seated in a straight line, either facing
                    forward or backward. The challenge often involves determining the relative positions of people or
                    objects based on certain conditions.</p>

                <h3>Key Features of Linear Arrangement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The seating is in a straight line.</li>
                    <li>Positions can be numbered from 1 to N (either from left to right or right to left).</li>
                    <li>The number of people or objects to be seated is fixed.</li>
                    <li>You may be asked to figure out the exact position of one or more individuals or objects based on
                        given clues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Linear Seating Arrangements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Straight Line:</b> Individuals are seated in a row, with a specific number of positions.</li>
                    <li><b>Facing Front or Back:</b> All individuals may be facing in one direction (forward or
                        backward), or there may be a mix of individuals facing different directions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example of a Linear Seating Arrangement Problem:</h3>
                <p>There are 5 friends (A, B, C, D, E) sitting in a row.</p>
                <p><b>The clues are:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A is to the left of C.</li>
                    <li>B is sitting to the right of D.</li>
                    <li>E is sitting at the extreme right end.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Based on the clues, the arrangement can be determined. One possible solution is: D,
                    B, A, C, E.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Circular Seating Arrangement</h2>
                <p>In a circular seating arrangement, people are seated around a circle. The main difference between
                    linear and circular seating is that in a circle, there are no extreme ends, and everyone is
                    connected to two neighbors. Circular seating is typically more complex because the arrangement can
                    either be clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>

                <h3>Key Features of Circular Arrangement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People are seated around a circle, and there are no beginning or end positions.</li>
                    <li>A person can be sitting at a fixed position relative to others, either clockwise or
                        counterclockwise.</li>
                    <li>A key feature is that the concept of "left" and "right" is important, and it can be determined
                        based on the direction they are facing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Circular Seating Arrangements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Facing the Center:</b> All people are seated in a circle and face the center of the circle.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Facing Outside:</b> All people are seated in a circle and face outward.</li>
                    <li><b>Alternating Directions:</b> Some people face the center and others face outside.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example of a Circular Seating Arrangement Problem:</h3>
                <p>6 friends (A, B, C, D, E, F) are sitting around a circular table.</p>
                <p><b>The clues are:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A is sitting directly opposite B.</li>
                    <li>C is to the immediate left of A.</li>
                    <li>D is not sitting next to E.</li>
                    <li>F is sitting opposite C.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> By using the clues, one can deduce the exact seating arrangement. For example: A, C,
                    F, B, D, E (arranged clockwise).</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>3. Square Seating Arrangement</h2>
                <p>A square seating arrangement is similar to a circular arrangement but arranged in a square shape. It
                    typically involves four sides, and people are seated at the corners or along the sides. This type of
                    seating arrangement is often used in problems involving a limited number of individuals or objects.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features of Square Arrangement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People or objects are seated at the corners of a square or along the edges.</li>
                    <li>Each person typically has a specific position relative to others.</li>
                    <li>Similar to circular seating, directions such as "left," "right," or "opposite" are significant
                        in square arrangements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Square Seating Arrangements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Corners:</b> People are seated at the four corners of the square.</li>
                    <li><b>Around the Sides:</b> People can be seated along the sides of the square, with some seated at
                        the corners and others in the middle of the sides.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example of a Square Seating Arrangement Problem:</h3>
                <p>4 people (P, Q, R, S) are seated at the corners of a square.</p>
                <p><b>The clues are:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P is sitting at one of the corners.</li>
                    <li>Q is sitting opposite P.</li>
                    <li>R is sitting to the left of Q.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Based on the given clues, the seating arrangement can be determined. One possible
                    solution is: P, R, Q, S.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Techniques to Solve Seating Arrangement Problems</h2>
                <h3>1. Visualizing the Setup:</h3>
                <p>Drawing a diagram or using a table can help in visualizing the arrangement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For linear seating, a simple row can be drawn.</li>
                    <li>For circular seating, a circle with labeled positions can be helpful.</li>
                    <li>For square seating, a square grid can be drawn with positions at the corners.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Using Clues Efficiently:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with the most specific clues (e.g., "A is sitting directly opposite B") and fill in the
                        positions from there.</li>
                    <li>Once a person is placed in one position, use the clues to determine the positions of others
                        relative to them.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to the direction they are facing (clockwise or counterclockwise).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Elimination:</h3>
                <p>If a person cannot be seated in certain positions due to a contradiction with the clues, eliminate
                    those possibilities.</p>

                <h3>4. Adjusting for Left or Right:</h3>
                <p>In circular and square seating, pay attention to whether people are facing inwards or outwards, as
                    this affects their relative positions.</p>

            <h1 id="Blood">2. Blood Relations & Family Trees in Analytical Reasoning</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Blood relations and family tree problems are a common part of analytical reasoning, where the goal is
                    to identify relationships between different individuals in a family or lineage based on given clues.
                    These problems require logical thinking to decipher how individuals are connected, and they often
                    involve terms like siblings, parents, spouses, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>1. Blood Relations</h2>
                <p>Blood relations refer to the direct and indirect connections between family members, which can be
                    through blood ties (biological relationships). These relationships are described using specific
                    terms, and the challenge in reasoning problems is to figure out these connections based on the clues
                    provided.</p>

                <h3>Common Blood Relation Terms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Father:</b> A male parent.</li>
                    <li><b>Mother:</b> A female parent.</li>
                    <li><b>Son:</b> A male child.</li>
                    <li><b>Daughter:</b> A female child.</li>
                    <li><b>Brother:</b> A male sibling.</li>
                    <li><b>Sister:</b> A female sibling.</li>
                    <li><b>Husband:</b> A male spouse.</li>
                    <li><b>Wife:</b> A female spouse.</li>
                    <li><b>Paternal Uncle:</b> The brother of one's father.</li>
                    <li><b>Maternal Uncle:</b> The brother of one's mother.</li>
                    <li><b>Paternal Aunt:</b> The sister of one's father.</li>
                    <li><b>Maternal Aunt:</b> The sister of one's mother.</li>
                    <li><b>Grandfather:</b> The father of one's parents.</li>
                    <li><b>Grandmother:</b> The mother of one's parents.</li>
                    <li><b>Cousin:</b> The child of one's uncle or aunt.</li>
                    <li><b>Nephew:</b> The son of one's sibling.</li>
                    <li><b>Niece:</b> The daughter of one's sibling.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Basic Types of Blood Relation Questions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Direct Blood Relations:</b> These involve relationships like father, mother, son, daughter,
                        etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Indirect Blood Relations:</b> These involve extended family relationships, like cousins,
                        uncles, aunts, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Mixed Blood Relations:</b> These problems involve a combination of direct and indirect
                        relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <p><b>Example 1:</b> "X is the father of Y. What is Y’s relationship with X?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Y is X’s son/daughter.</p>

                <p><b>Example 2:</b> "A is the sister of B. B is the father of C. What is C’s relationship to A?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> C is A’s niece/nephew.</p>

                <p><b>Example 3:</b> "X is the brother of Y. Y’s daughter Z is married to W. W is the son of T. What is
                    X’s relationship with T?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> X is T’s brother-in-law.</p>

                <h3>Example of Blood Relation Problem:</h3>
                <p><b>Clue:</b> "A’s father is B. C is the mother of A. D is the brother of A. What is the relationship
                    of D to C?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> D is C’s son (as C is A’s mother, and D is A’s brother).</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>2. Family Trees</h2>
                <p>A family tree is a diagram that represents family relationships over multiple generations. It helps
                    in visualizing the blood relations of a person, showing ancestors, descendants, and other family
                    members.</p>

                <h3>Basic Structure of a Family Tree:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The root of the family tree often represents the earliest known ancestor.</li>
                    <li>The branches represent the descendants of that ancestor.</li>
                    <li>Vertical lines show the relationship between generations.</li>
                    <li>Horizontal lines show sibling relationships (brothers and sisters).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Points in Reading and Interpreting Family Trees:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Generations:</b> Family members in the same level (or row) of a family tree are usually from
                        the same generation.</li>
                    <li><b>Marriage Lines:</b> A line between two individuals represents a marriage.</li>
                    <li><b>Vertical Lines:</b> A vertical line connects parents to their children.</li>
                    <li><b>Siblings:</b> Siblings are typically connected by horizontal lines.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example of a Family Tree:</h3>
                <p>Here’s an example of a simple family tree:</p>
                <pre>
            Grandfather
                |
        -------------------
        |                 |
      Father              Uncle
        |                 |
     ---------------      -----------
     |             |      |         |
  Son (X)       Daughter (Y)  Nephew (Z)
    </pre>
                <p><b>In this family tree:</b></p>

                <h2>Techniques to Solve Blood Relations and Family Tree Problems</h2>
                <h3>i. Visualize the Relationships:</h3>
                <p>Whenever a family tree is mentioned, draw it out. This helps in better understanding and organizing
                    relationships visually.</p>

                <h3>ii. Work from Known Facts:</h3>
                <p>Start with the given facts in the problem (e.g., A is the son of B) and try to work backward and
                    forward in the family tree to establish connections.</p>

                <h3>iii. Use the Correct Terms:</h3>
                <p>Be careful with the use of family relation terms like uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, etc. The correct
                    understanding of these terms is crucial to solving the problems.</p>

                <h3>iv. Follow the Gender-specific Relationships:</h3>
                <p>Gender is often an important factor in blood relations, especially for terms like uncle, aunt,
                    nephew, niece, etc.</p>

                <h3>v. Count Generations:</h3>
                <p>In more complex family tree problems, counting generations can help identify the level of
                    relationship (grandparent, grandchild, cousin, etc.).</p>

                <h3>vi. Pay Attention to Marriages:</h3>
                <p>Relationships through marriage (in-laws, husband, wife, etc.) must also be considered in family trees
                    and blood relations.</p>

                <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                <p><b>Clue:</b> "A is the son of B. C is the sister of B. D is the husband of C. E is the daughter of D
                    and C. F is the son of A. What is the relationship of F to D?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A is the son of B, so B is A's father.</li>
                    <li>C is the sister of B, making C A’s aunt.</li>
                    <li>D is the husband of C, making D A’s uncle.</li>
                    <li>E is the daughter of D and C, so E is A’s cousin.</li>
                    <li>F is the son of A, so F is A’s son.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, F is the nephew of D.</li>

            <h1 id="Distances">3. Directions & Distances in Analytical Reasoning</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>In analytical reasoning, directions and distances problems are designed to test your ability to
                    understand and interpret spatial relationships. These problems often involve a person moving in
                    different directions, and you must calculate their final position or identify a specific point based
                    on the given directions and distances.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Directions</h2>
                <p>Directions refer to the specific paths or movements someone follows in relation to a starting point.
                    The four basic directions are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>North (N)</b></li>
                    <li><b>South (S)</b></li>
                    <li><b>East (E)</b></li>
                    <li><b>West (W)</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can also encounter intermediate directions, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>North-East (NE)</b></li>
                    <li><b>South-East (SE)</b></li>
                    <li><b>South-West (SW)</b></li>
                    <li><b>North-West (NW)</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These directions are used to describe movements and locations in a coordinate-like system, where each
                    direction corresponds to a 90° angle (or a combination of those for intermediate directions).</p>

                <h3>Basic Directions Terminology:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Left and Right:</b> These terms are relative to the direction the person is facing. For
                        example, if someone is facing North, left would be West, and right would be East.</li>
                    <li><b>Turning:</b> When someone turns (like turning 90° left or right), the direction they are
                        facing changes, affecting the subsequent movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Distances</h2>
                <p>Distances refer to how far someone travels in a particular direction. This can be measured in units
                    like meters, kilometers, or any given unit of distance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Straight-line Distance:</b> The direct distance between two points, without considering the
                        path.</li>
                    <li><b>Total Distance:</b> The overall distance traveled, considering all the turns and movements
                        made.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When combined with directions, distances provide a way to determine the final position of someone
                    after traveling a certain distance in each direction.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Types of Problems in Directions & Distances</h2>

                <h3>a. Simple Direction Problems</h3>
                <p>These problems typically involve one person moving in specific directions, and you need to figure out
                    their final position or determine the relationship between two points.</p>

                <h4>Example Problem:</h4>
                <p>"A person starts at point X and walks 10 meters North, then turns left and walks 5 meters. Then, he
                    turns right and walks 10 meters. In which direction is he now from his starting point?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starts at point X.</li>
                    <li>Moves 10 meters North.</li>
                    <li>Turns left (to the West) and walks 5 meters.</li>
                    <li>Turns right (to the North) and walks 10 meters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, after moving, the person is 5 meters North and 5 meters West from the starting point (point X).
                    Therefore, the final direction is North-West.</p>

                <h3>b. Distance Calculation Problems</h3>
                <p>In these problems, you are given several directions and distances, and you are asked to find the
                    total distance or the straight-line distance between two points.</p>

                <h4>Example Problem:</h4>
                <p>"A person walks 5 km East, then 10 km North, and then 5 km West. What is the straight-line distance
                    between the starting point and the final point?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The person walks 5 km East, then 5 km West, so there is no net movement in the East-West
                        direction.</li>
                    <li>The person walks 10 km North.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, the total distance between the starting point and the final point is simply 10 km North.
                </p>

                <h3>c. Turning and Relative Directions</h3>
                <p>These problems involve turns at various points and may include both direction changes and distance
                    traveled.</p>

                <h4>Example Problem:</h4>
                <p>"A person walks 10 meters East, then turns right and walks 15 meters, turns right again and walks 10
                    meters. Finally, he turns left and walks 5 meters. How far is he from his starting point?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start at the origin.</li>
                    <li>Walk 10 meters East.</li>
                    <li>Turn right (now facing South), walk 15 meters.</li>
                    <li>Turn right again (now facing West), walk 10 meters.</li>
                    <li>Turn left (now facing South), walk 5 meters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, the person is 15 meters South and 5 meters West from the starting point. Using the Pythagorean
                    theorem, we calculate the straight-line distance:</p>
                <pre>Distance = sqrt(15² + 5²) = sqrt(225 + 25) = sqrt(250) ≈ 15.81 meters</pre>
                <p>Thus, the person is approximately 15.81 meters from the starting point.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Advanced Direction and Distance Problems</h2>
                <p>Advanced problems may involve more complex movements and can involve directions like "North-East" or
                    "South-West," as well as relative movement, such as changes in direction at different points. These
                    problems may also require the use of the coordinate plane to find the final position.</p>

                <h4>Example Problem:</h4>
                <p>"A person starts at point P and moves 4 km North-East, then 3 km South-East. How far and in which
                    direction is he from point P?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move 4 km North-East. This is along the 45° line (diagonal), so break it into two components: 4
                        km North and 4 km East.</li>
                    <li>Move 3 km South-East. This is along the 45° line as well, so break it into two components: 3 km
                        South and 3 km East.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, sum up the movements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>North-South:</b> 4 km North - 3 km South = 1 km North</li>
                    <li><b>East-West:</b> 4 km East + 3 km East = 7 km East</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, the person is 1 km North and 7 km East from point P. The straight-line distance can be
                    calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:</p>
                <pre>Distance = sqrt(1² + 7²) = sqrt(1 + 49) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 km</pre>
                <p>Therefore, the person is approximately 7.07 km in the North-East direction from point P.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Solving Tips for Direction & Distance Problems</h2>
                <h3>Use Cardinal Directions:</h3>
                <p>Always keep in mind that North, South, East, and West are fundamental directions. For non-cardinal
                    directions, break them into their components (e.g., North-East = North + East).</p>

                <h3>Diagram:</h3>
                <p>Drawing a diagram or using a coordinate system helps visualize movements and directions. This is
                    especially useful in complex problems involving multiple turns and distances.</p>

                <h3>Apply Pythagorean Theorem:</h3>
                <p>For calculating straight-line distances (especially in problems involving two perpendicular
                    directions), use the Pythagorean theorem:</p>
                <pre>Distance = sqrt(x² + y²)</pre>
                <p>where x and y are the distances moved in the East-West and North-South directions, respectively.</p>

                <h3>Relative Directions:</h3>
                <p>When dealing with turns (left/right), ensure you update the direction the person is facing after each
                    turn.</p>

                <h3>Component Breakdown:</h3>
                <p>For diagonal movements like North-East or South-West, break them into their North-South and East-West
                    components to calculate distances more easily.</p>

                <h3>a. Simple Order Problems</h3>
                <p>These problems involve arranging individuals or items in a particular order based on a given set of
                    conditions, such as height, age, etc.</p>

                    taller than E but shorter than C. B is taller than E. Arrange them in order of height."</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the given information, we know the relative height relationships:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The total number of students is 50.</li>
                    <li>B’s position from the bottom is 20th, meaning there are 19 students below B.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, B’s position from the top will be: 50 - 20 + 1 = 31.</li>
                    <li>So, B is ranked 31st from the top.</li>

                    right of A, C is sitting to the left of D, and E is sitting at the 5th position. What is the
                    position of C?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A is at position 1, B is to the right of A (so B is at position 2).</li>
                    <li>E is at position 5.</li>
                    <li>C is to the left of D. So, D must be at position 4, and C will be at position 3.</li>
                    <li>The positions from left to right are: A, B, C, D, E.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>ii. Key Concepts in Order & Ranking</h2>
                <h3>a. Relative Position and Absolute Position</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Relative Position:</b> The position of an individual or object relative to others. For
                        example, A is taller than B, or C finishes before D.</li>
                    <li><b>Absolute Position:</b> The exact position in a list or ranking, such as "1st" or "10th."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>b. Direct & Indirect Relationships</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Direct Relationship:</b> Explicit information about the position or order of individuals
                        (e.g., "A is taller than B").</li>
                    <li><b>Indirect Relationship:</b> Information about one person's position is indirectly related to
                        others, requiring inferences (e.g., "A is taller than B, who is taller than C").</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>c. Use of Positions and Places</h3>
                <p>For ranking problems, positions are often numbered from the top or bottom, and this numbering needs
                    to be accounted for. Common terms to note are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>From the top:</b> The position starting from 1 at the top.</li>
                    <li><b>From the bottom:</b> The position starting from 1 at the bottom, going upward.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>iii. Solving Strategies for Order & Ranking Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Create a Visual Representation:</b> Drawing a chart or a number line can be useful,
                        especially in problems with multiple relationships.</li>
                    <li><b>Break Down Information:</b> Start with the most direct information and build up the ranking
                        step-by-step.</li>
                    <li><b>Work with Known Ranks First:</b> If some positions are known, use them as anchors to fill in
                        the rest of the information.</li>
                    <li><b>Use Elimination:</b> If multiple conditions exist, eliminate impossible arrangements, which
                        often leads to the correct order.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>iv. Practice Example Problems</h2>
                <h4>Example 1:</h4>
                <p>"In a group of six friends, A is taller than B but shorter than C. D is shorter than E but taller
                    than A. E is taller than C. Arrange them from shortest to tallest."</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the clues: A < C, A < D < E, and E> C.</li>
                    <li>The order of height from shortest to tallest is: B, A, D, C, E.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h4>Example 2:</h4>
                <p>"In a group of 8 students, A is ranked 3rd from the top. What is A’s rank from the bottom?"</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total students = 8.</li>
                    <li>A’s position from the top = 3rd.</li>
                    <li>A’s position from the bottom = 8 - 3 + 1 = 6.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, A’s rank from the bottom is 6th.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>v. Common Terms in Order & Ranking Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>From the top:</b> Refers to positions starting from the first in the list.</li>
                    <li><b>From the bottom:</b> Refers to positions starting from the last in the list.</li>
                    <li><b>Before/After:</b> Indicates the relative position of one individual or item compared to
                        another.</li>
                    <li><b>Tied positions:</b> Sometimes individuals may have the same rank. The problem may require
                        dealing with tied positions.</li>
