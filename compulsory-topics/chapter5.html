                <ul>
                    <li><b>Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):</b> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in
                        motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.</li>
                    <li><b>Newton's Second Law:</b> Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).</li>
                    <li><b>Newton's Third Law:</b> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>

                <p>Climate Change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other
                    atmospheric conditions over extended periods (decades to centuries). Global Warming, a major driver
                    of climate change, is the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to the buildup of
                    greenhouse gases.</p>
