                    and cultural grievances. The immediate cause was the introduction of the Enfield rifle which used
                    cartridges greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.</p>

                        Indian independence movement. It led to the end of the Mughal Empire and the direct control of

                <p><b>Context:</b> The Partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon in 1905 was a key event that sparked
                    nationalist movements. The partition aimed to divide the largely Bengali-speaking population along
                    religious lines to weaken the nationalist movement.</p>

                <h4>Champaran Satyagraha (1917)</h4>
                <p>Gandhi led the first successful Satyagraha movement in Champaran (Bihar) against the exploitation of
                    indigo farmers by British planters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> This victory marked the beginning of Gandhian mass movements in India.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Kheda Satyagraha (1918)</h4>
                <p>Farmers in Kheda (Gujarat) were suffering from high taxes and crop failure. Gandhi supported their
                    struggle for tax relief.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The British government relented, and the farmers were granted relief.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–1922)</h4>
                <p>After the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, urging
                    Indians to boycott British institutions and goods.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement was widespread, and people from all sections of society
                        participated.</li>
                    <li><b>Suspension:</b> The movement was suspended by Gandhi in 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident
                        where protesters turned violent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Salt March (1930)</h4>
                <p>Gandhi led the Dandi March to defy the British monopoly on salt production.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Impact:</b> The Salt March became a symbol of India’s defiance against British rule and
                        garnered worldwide attention.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Civil Disobedience Movement (1930–1934)</h4>
                <p>The Salt March was part of a broader movement that involved breaking laws to protest British colonial
                    policies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement gained widespread support, and many Indians were arrested,
                        including Gandhi.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Quit India Movement (1942)</h4>
                <p>During World War II, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement demanding an immediate end to British
                    rule in India.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement was crushed, but it made it clear that India was no longer willing
                        to tolerate British rule.</li>
                </ul>
