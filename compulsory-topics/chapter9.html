                <h2>i. Overview</h2>
                <p>Reasoning refers to the mental process of thinking logically and making sense of complex situations
                    or problems. Problem Solving involves identifying a problem, understanding its components, and
                    finding a solution through logical steps. Both reasoning and problem-solving are critical skills in
                    competitive exams, daily life, and professional work.</p>

                            <li><b>Odd One Out:</b> Finding the item that does not fit in a group (e.g., identifying the
                                object that differs from the others in color, shape, or function).</li>
                            <li><b>Mirror & Water Images:</b> Identifying how an object would appear in a mirror or

                        based on the problem type (e.g., algebraic methods for math problems, logical deductions for
                        reasoning).</li>
                    <li><b>Trial and Error:</b> Trying different solutions and learning from mistakes until the correct

                    <li><b>Work Backwards:</b> Start from the desired solution and work backwards to figure out the
                        steps to reach it.</li>
                    <li><b>Logical Deduction:</b> Use reasoning to eliminate impossible or unlikely solutions.</li>
                    <li><b>Simplification:</b> Simplify the problem by ignoring unnecessary details or using
                        approximations to get a quick solution.</li>

                        solution.</li>
                    <li><b>Logical Consistency:</b> Problems often have specific rules or conditions that must be
                        followed for consistency.</li>
                    <li><b>Creativity:</b> Sometimes, thinking outside the box and using innovative methods can solve
                        seemingly difficult problems.</li>

                <h2>i. Overview</h2>
                <p>Decision Making is the process of selecting the best course of action from multiple alternatives
                    based on a set of criteria. It is a vital skill in both personal and professional life, especially
                    for managers, leaders, and individuals facing complex situations. Effective decision-making involves
                    evaluating information, considering potential outcomes, and making choices that align with goals and
                    values.</p>

                        unfamiliar situations.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examples: Choosing a business strategy, hiring employees, or investing in new

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify the Problem:</b> Recognize that a decision needs to be made. Understand the issue or
                        opportunity at hand.</li>
                    <li><b>Gather Information:</b> Collect relevant data and information to make an informed decision.
                    </li>

                        address the problem.</li>
                    <li><b>Evaluate Alternatives:</b> Assess the pros and cons of each option based on criteria such as
                        feasibility, cost, benefits, and alignment with objectives.</li>
                    <li><b>Make the Decision:</b> Choose the best alternative based on the evaluation.</li>
                    <li><b>Implement the Decision:</b> Put the chosen solution into action, ensuring the necessary
                        resources and plans are in place.</li>
                    <li><b>Evaluate the Decision:</b> After implementation, review the outcome to assess whether the

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Autocratic Decision Making:</b> One person makes decisions without input from others. Common
                        in time-sensitive situations but may not consider the team’s insights.</li>
                    <li><b>Democratic Decision Making:</b> Involves consulting with team members and considering their
                        opinions before making a decision.</li>
                    <li><b>Consensus Decision Making:</b> A collaborative approach where all members of a group agree on
                        a decision. Takes longer but ensures everyone is on the same page.</li>
                    <li><b>Consultative Decision Making:</b> A mix of autocratic and democratic. The leader makes the
                        final decision after consulting others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>v. Decision-Making Models</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rational Decision-Making Model:</b> A step-by-step approach where decision-makers logically
                        analyze the problem, consider alternatives, and choose the most beneficial option.</li>
                    <li><b>Bounded Rationality Model:</b> Suggests that people often make decisions with limited
                        information and within constraints, such as time, knowledge, or cognitive capacity. They settle
                        for a satisfactory solution, not necessarily the best one.</li>
                    <li><b>Intuitive Decision-Making:</b> Decisions are made based on instinct or gut feeling rather
                        than rational analysis. This model is often used when decisions need to be made quickly, and
                        there is little information available.</li>
                    <li><b>Incremental Decision-Making:</b> A gradual approach where decisions are made in small steps,
                        often adjusting as new information becomes available.</li>
                    <li><b>Creative Decision-Making:</b> Involves brainstorming and out-of-the-box thinking to generate
                        innovative solutions when facing complex problems.</li>

                    <li><b>Confirmation Bias:</b> Seeking information that confirms one’s existing beliefs or decisions
                        and ignoring contradictory evidence.</li>
                    <li><b>Groupthink:</b> A tendency for groups to make decisions that are overly consensus-driven and
                        may not be the best options, often to avoid conflict.</li>
                    <li><b>Escalation of Commitment:</b> Continuing with a decision or project that is failing because
                        of the time or resources already invested.</li>
