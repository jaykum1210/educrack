                        countries, though it has been slow due to disagreements on key issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vii. Dispute Settlement Process</h2>
                <p>The WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism allows member countries to challenge the trade practices of
                    other nations that violate WTO agreements.</p>
                <ol>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Unequal Benefits:</b> Developing countries argue that the WTO’s rules benefit wealthy nations
                        more and that their interests are often sidelined in negotiations.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of Progress on Key Issues:</b> Talks, especially under the Doha Round, have stalled due
                        to disagreements over issues like agriculture subsidies, intellectual property, and market
                        access.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Sovereignty:</b> Some nations feel that the WTO's rules undermine their ability to
                        make independent policy decisions, especially in areas like public health, the environment, and
                        labor rights.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ix. Role in the Global Economy</h2>
                <p>The WTO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability of the global trading system. By providing a
                    rules-based framework, it helps reduce the risk of trade wars and ensures that disputes are handled
                    systematically.</p>
                <p>It encourages global economic integration and facilitates trade between both developed and developing
                    nations, promoting global economic growth.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Surveillance and Economic Analysis:</b> The IMF monitors global economic trends, analyzing

                        recommends corrective actions when necessary.</li>
                    <li><b>Lending to Member Countries:</b> The IMF provides financial support to countries facing
                        severe balance-of-payments problems (when a country cannot pay for imports or service its
                        external debt). Loans are typically provided with conditions that require the country to

                    <li><b>Technical Assistance and Capacity Building:</b> The IMF helps countries strengthen their

                    <li><b>Extended Fund Facility (EFF):</b> Longer-term financial assistance aimed at addressing more
                        structural economic problems.</li>
                    <li><b>Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs):</b> Loans that require countries to implement certain
                        economic policies or reforms, like reducing government spending, privatizing state-owned

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Definition:</b> SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement
                        member countries' official reserves.</li>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> SDRs provide liquidity to the global economy by giving countries an additional
                        resource to access if they face economic crises or shortages of foreign exchange reserves.</li>
                    <li><b>Value:</b> The value of SDRs is based on a basket of major currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP,
                        CNY).</li>

                <ul>

                        is determined by its financial contribution to the IMF (its quota). The larger a country’s
                        quota, the more influence it has in decision-making.</li>
                    <li><b>Role of Major Economies:</b> Major economies like the U.S., Japan, and Germany have the
                        highest quotas, giving them greater influence in the IMF’s decisions.</li>

                        Thailand through financial assistance programs to stabilize their economies.</li>
                    <li><b>2008 Global Financial Crisis:</b> The IMF took steps to stabilize the global economy,
                        providing loans to countries facing severe economic downturns and advising on global policy

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Conditionality and Austerity:</b> IMF lending often comes with conditions, such as austerity
                        measures (cutting public spending, raising taxes), which critics argue may harm vulnerable
                        populations and slow down economic recovery.</li>
                    <li><b>Influence of Major Economies:</b> The voting system based on quotas gives wealthier nations
                        more power in IMF decision-making, leading to accusations of unequal representation.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Sovereignty:</b> Some countries feel that IMF programs undermine their ability to

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Key Features of the Agreement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):</b> Each country is required to submit a plan
                        (NDC) outlining its climate actions and emission reduction targets, which are reviewed and
                        updated every five years.</li>
                    <li><b>Global Stocktake:</b> Every five years, the parties will assess collective progress toward
                        achieving the goals and increase their efforts accordingly.</li>
                    <li><b>Transparency and Accountability:</b> Countries must report on their emissions and progress
                        toward their climate goals. These reports are subject to an international review process.</li>
                    <li><b>Climate Finance:</b> Developed countries are committed to providing financial resources to
                        developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change. The goal is to mobilize
                        $100 billion annually by 2020, with a promise to increase support in the future.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Major Provisions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Temperature Limit:</b> The central aim is to limit global warming to 1.5°C, which would
                        reduce climate impacts like sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and ecosystem destruction.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Adaptation and Loss & Damage:</b> It emphasizes the need for adaptation measures, especially
                        for the most vulnerable countries, and addresses loss and damage due to climate change impacts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Long-Term Low Emission Strategies:</b> Encourages countries to develop long-term low-emission
                        development strategies to achieve net-zero emissions in the second half of the 21st century.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Financial Commitments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>$100 Billion per Year:</b> Developed countries are committed to providing $100 billion
                        annually by 2020 to help developing nations mitigate and adapt to climate change. This goal is
                        to be extended beyond 2025, and a new financial goal is to be agreed upon.</li>
                    <li><b>Private Sector Involvement:</b> The agreement encourages the mobilization of private sector
                        investments to complement public funds.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vi. Role of Developing Countries</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Differentiated Responsibilities:</b> Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, where developed countries had
                        legally binding targets, the Paris Agreement allows for flexibility, recognizing that developing
                        countries have different capabilities and responsibilities.</li>
                    <li><b>Support for Developing Nations:</b> Developed nations are expected to provide financial and
                        technical assistance to developing countries to help them achieve their climate goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vii. Criticism of the Paris Agreement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Voluntary Commitments:</b> Some critics argue that the agreement’s reliance on voluntary
                        commitments (NDCs) from countries is too weak and might not result in sufficient global emission
                        reductions.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:</b> There are no binding penalties for countries that fail to
                        meet their targets, which raises concerns about accountability.</li>
                    <li><b>Financial Gaps:</b> While the agreement includes financial commitments, the promised $100
                        billion per year has been seen as insufficient, and there are concerns about whether it will be
                        achieved.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>viii. Achievements and Progress</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Global Participation:</b> As of 2025, nearly every country in the world has ratified the
                        Paris Agreement, representing a global consensus on addressing climate change.</li>
                    <li><b>Enhanced Action:</b> The agreement has spurred increased national action on climate change,
                        including national policies, investment in renewable energy, and carbon pricing initiatives.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Private Sector and Civil Society Engagement:</b> The Paris Agreement has encouraged a wide
                        range of non-governmental actors, including cities, businesses, and civil society organizations,
                        to commit to climate action.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ix. Challenges</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ambitious Goals vs. Reality:</b> Despite progress, global emissions are still rising, and
                        many countries are not on track to meet their NDCs, indicating a gap between current action and
                        the needed efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C.</li>
                    <li><b>Geopolitical Tensions:</b> Changes in leadership and policies in major emitting countries can
                        affect the global commitment to the agreement (e.g., the U.S. withdrawal under President Trump
                        and rejoining under President Biden).</li>
                    <li><b>Financing Issues:</b> Adequate funding for climate adaptation and mitigation, especially for
                        developing countries, remains a significant challenge.</li>

                <h2>i. Overview</h2>
                <p>Global Trade refers to the exchange of goods and services between countries across international
                    borders or territories. It is a key component of international economics, fostering economic growth,
                    improving consumer choice, and contributing to global development.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Importance of Global Trade</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Encourages innovation, enhances productivity, and boosts economic growth
                        by allowing countries to specialize in what they do best.</li>
                    <li><b>Access to Resources:</b> Enables countries to access resources and products that are
                        unavailable or expensive to produce domestically.</li>
                    <li><b>Employment:</b> Global trade creates jobs by stimulating the growth of businesses involved in
                        production, distribution, and logistics.</li>
                    <li><b>Cultural Exchange:</b> Encourages the exchange of ideas, technology, and cultural goods,
                        leading to a more interconnected world.</li>

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Major Theories of Global Trade</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Absolute Advantage (Adam Smith):</b> A country has an absolute advantage over another if it
                        can produce a good more efficiently (i.e., using fewer resources).</li>
                    <li><b>Comparative Advantage (David Ricardo):</b> Even if a country doesn’t have an absolute
                        advantage, it can still benefit from trade by specializing in producing goods for which it has a
                        lower opportunity cost.</li>
                    <li><b>Heckscher-Ohlin Theory:</b> Trade patterns are determined by a country’s relative abundance
                        of factors of production (like labor, capital, land). Countries export goods that use their
                        abundant factors of production and import goods that require factors they lack.</li>
                    <li><b>New Trade Theory:</b> Emphasizes economies of scale and network effects, suggesting that
                        large firms dominate in international trade due to their ability to exploit cost advantages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Trade Agreements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bilateral Agreements:</b> Agreements between two countries to promote trade by reducing
                        tariffs and other trade barriers.</li>
                    <li><b>Multilateral Agreements:</b> Involves multiple countries agreeing to terms for trade, such as
                        the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements or regional trade agreements like the North
                        American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the European Union (EU), or the Comprehensive and
                        Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).</li>
                    <li><b>Free Trade Areas (FTA):</b> These agreements reduce or eliminate trade barriers like tariffs,
                        but each country can set its own trade policies with non-member nations (e.g., ASEAN Free Trade
                        Area).</li>
                    <li><b>Customs Unions:</b> A group of countries that not only remove tariffs between members but
                        also adopt a common external tariff (e.g., European Union).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>vii. Trade Barriers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tariffs:</b> Taxes imposed on imports, making foreign goods more expensive and less
                        competitive with domestic products.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Tariff Barriers:</b> Includes quotas (limits on the quantity of goods imported),
                        subsidies (financial assistance to local businesses), and stringent regulations.</li>
                    <li><b>Trade Protectionism:</b> Countries may adopt protectionist policies to protect domestic
                        industries from foreign competition, which can limit global trade.</li>
                    <li><b>Currency Manipulation:</b> Countries may manipulate their currency exchange rates to make
                        their exports cheaper, affecting global trade balances.</li>
                </ul>

                        companies to source materials and services from around the world, creating complex supply
                        chains.</li>
                    <li><b>Challenges:</b> Disruptions to global supply chains (e.g., due to natural disasters,
                        pandemics, or trade wars) can impact the availability and cost of goods.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>ix. Challenges Facing Global Trade</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Trade Wars and Tariffs:</b> Tensions between countries can result in higher tariffs, leading
                        to reduced trade and increased costs for consumers.</li>
                    <li><b>Environmental Concerns:</b> The transportation of goods globally contributes to carbon
                        emissions, and there is growing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly trade
                        practices.</li>
                    <li><b>Global Economic Imbalances:</b> Trade imbalances, where some countries export far more than
                        they import, can lead to long-term economic instability.</li>
                    <li><b>Technological Disruption:</b> Advances in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) could
                        disrupt traditional industries and change global trade patterns.</li>

                    <li><b>Digital Trade:</b> The growth of digital products and services (cloud computing, data
                        services, e-commerce) will become a major driver of global trade.</li>
                    <li><b>Sustainability:</b> As countries and companies become more concerned with environmental
                        sustainability, there will likely be a shift toward greener trade policies and sustainable
                        production practices.</li>
                    <li><b>Geopolitical Changes:</b> Political and economic shifts (like the rise of China and potential
                        new trade blocs) could reshape trade patterns.</li>
