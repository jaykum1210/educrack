            <div class="enzyme-description">
                <p>Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up the rate of chemical reactions in living organisms
                    without being consumed in the process. They are highly specific, work efficiently under mild
                    conditions, and are essential for numerous biochemical processes.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>1. Properties of Enzymes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biological Catalysts:</strong> Enzymes accelerate the rate of biochemical reactions
                        by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Enzymes are highly specific to their substrates. This
                        specificity arises due to the lock and key model or induced fit model, which ensures that
                        only a particular substrate fits into the enzyme's active site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Enzymes increase reaction rates by a factor of millions,
                        allowing biochemical reactions to occur quickly under normal physiological conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Enzyme activity can be regulated by factors such as
                        temperature, pH, and the presence of activators or inhibitors. This regulation ensures that
                        metabolic processes occur when needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Enzymes are not consumed in the reaction and can be reused
                        multiple times to catalyze the same type of reaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitivity to Environmental Conditions:</strong> Enzymes are sensitive to
                        temperature and pH. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH at which it works most
                        efficiently. Extreme conditions can lead to denaturation, where the enzyme loses its
                        functional shape.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>2. Mechanism of Action</h2>
                <p>Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed, making the
                    reaction faster. The process involves the following steps:</p>

                <h3>(a) Formation of Enzyme-Substrate Complex (ES Complex):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Substrate Binding:</strong> The substrate (the molecule that is going to be
                        transformed in the reaction) binds to the enzyme's active site. The active site is a
                        specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Induced Fit:</strong> In the induced fit model, the enzyme undergoes a slight
                        conformational change upon substrate binding, which helps in properly orienting the
                        substrate for the reaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>(b) Catalysis:</h3>
                <p>Once the enzyme-substrate complex is formed, the enzyme facilitates the conversion of the
                    substrate into the product by lowering the activation energy. This is achieved through several
                    mechanisms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proximity and Orientation:</strong> Enzymes bring substrates into close proximity
                        and in the correct orientation, which increases the likelihood of a successful reaction.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Strain:</strong> Enzymes may apply physical strain on the substrate, weakening
                        certain bonds and facilitating their breaking or formation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microenvironment:</strong> Enzymes can create a specific environment (e.g., acidic
                        or basic conditions) at the active site that promotes the reaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Covalent Catalysis:</strong> Some enzymes form temporary covalent bonds with the
                        substrate, which helps in breaking or forming bonds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>(c) Formation of Product:</h3>
                <p>After the substrate undergoes the catalytic process, the enzyme releases the products. The enzyme
                    itself is unchanged and can bind to new substrate molecules.</p>

                <h3>(d) Release of Product:</h3>
                <p>The enzyme-product complex dissociates, and the product(s) are released from the enzyme's active
                    site. The enzyme is free to bind to a new substrate and repeat the process.</p>

                <h2>3. Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its activity
                        is maximized. Higher temperatures can cause enzymes to denature (lose their shape), while
                        lower temperatures slow down enzyme activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Enzymes also have an optimal pH range. Extreme pH levels can disrupt
                        the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds in the enzyme, leading to denaturation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Substrate Concentration:</strong> As substrate concentration increases, enzyme
                        activity increases, but only up to a point. When the enzyme becomes saturated with
                        substrate, the rate of reaction levels off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enzyme Concentration:</strong> Increasing enzyme concentration leads to an increase
                        in reaction rate, provided there is enough substrate present.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inhibitors:</strong> Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that reduce the enzyme's
                        activity. They can be classified into:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Competitive Inhibitors:</strong> These bind to the active site of the
                                enzyme, competing with the substrate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-Competitive Inhibitors:</strong> These bind to a site other than the
                                active site, causing a conformational change in the enzyme that reduces its
                                activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Allosteric Inhibitors:</strong> These bind to a site other than the active
                                site and change the enzyme's shape, decreasing its affinity for the substrate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Activators:</strong> Some enzymes require the presence of certain molecules or ions
                        to be activated, called cofactors or coenzymes (e.g., vitamins, metal ions).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>4. Types of Enzymes Based on Function</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hydrolases:</strong> Catalyze hydrolysis reactions, where water is used to break
                        bonds (e.g., amylase, lipase).</li>
                    <li><strong>Oxidoreductases:</strong> Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions (e.g.,
                        dehydrogenases, oxidases).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transferases:</strong> Transfer functional groups (e.g., kinases, transaminases).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ligases:</strong> Catalyze the joining of two molecules, often with the hydrolysis
                        of ATP (e.g., DNA ligase).</li>
                    <li><strong>Isomerases:</strong> Catalyze the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule (e.g.,
                        glucose-6-phosphate isomerase).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lyases:</strong> Break bonds without the involvement of water (e.g.,
                        decarboxylases).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>5. Enzyme Inhibition and Regulation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Inhibition:</strong> The inhibitor resembles the substrate and competes
                        for the active site. The inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate
                        concentration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Competitive Inhibition:</strong> The inhibitor binds to an allosteric site (a
                        site other than the active site), causing a conformational change in the enzyme that
                        decreases its activity. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome by adding more substrate.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Allosteric Regulation:</strong> Some enzymes are regulated by molecules that bind to
                        an allosteric site, which can either increase (activators) or decrease (inhibitors) enzyme
                        activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback Inhibition:</strong> In metabolic pathways, the end product may inhibit the
                        activity of an enzyme early in the pathway to prevent overproduction of the product.</li>
                </ul>
