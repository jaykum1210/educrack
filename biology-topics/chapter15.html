            <div class="principles-of-inheritance">
                <p>The principles of inheritance are the fundamental concepts in genetics that describe how traits
                    are passed from parents to offspring. These principles were first discovered by Gregor Mendel,
                    an Austrian biologist, through his work on pea plants. Mendel's laws of inheritance laid the
                    foundation for the modern understanding of genetics.</p>

                <h2>Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance</h2>
                <p>Mendel proposed three main laws of inheritance based on his experiments with pea plants. These
                    laws are:</p>

                <h3>i. Law of Segregation (First Law)</h3>
                <p>This law states that each organism has two alleles (alternative forms of a gene) for each trait,
                    one inherited from each parent. These alleles segregate (separate) during gamete formation, so
                    each gamete carries only one allele for each trait. When two gametes fuse during fertilization,
                    the resulting offspring receives one allele from each parent, restoring the pair of alleles for
                    that trait.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a trait like flower color (where the purple flower color (P) is
                    dominant over white (p)):</p>
                <pre>
                        Parents: Pp (Purple) × Pp (Purple)
                        Gametes: P or p from each parent
                        Offspring: PP, Pp, Pp, pp
                        The purple color will be observed in both PP and Pp (because P is dominant), while the white color will appear only in the pp offspring.
                    </pre>

                <h3>ii. Law of Independent Assortment (Second Law)</h3>
                <p>This law states that genes for different traits are inherited independently of one another,
                    provided they are located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. The
                    inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another trait.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If seed color (Y = yellow, y = green) and seed shape (R = round, r =
                    wrinkled) are on different chromosomes, the inheritance of one trait (e.g., seed color) will not
                    affect the inheritance of the other (e.g., seed shape).</p>
                <pre>
                        Parents: YyRr × YyRr
                        Gametes: YR, Yr, yR, yr from each parent
                        Offspring: The combination of these alleles in the offspring can be YYRR, YYRr, YyRR, YyRr, YyRr, yyRR, yyRr, etc.
                    </pre>

                <h3>iii. Law of Dominance (Third Law)</h3>
                <p>This law states that in a heterozygous individual (with two different alleles), the dominant
                    allele will mask the expression of the recessive allele. The recessive allele will only be
                    expressed when the individual is homozygous recessive (having two recessive alleles for that
                    trait).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the flower color trait where purple (P) is dominant and white (p)
                    is recessive:</p>
                <pre>
                        PP or Pp will result in a purple flower (because P is dominant).
                        pp will result in a white flower (because the recessive allele p has no dominant allele to mask its expression).
                    </pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Inheritance Patterns</h2>
                <h3>i. Monohybrid Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Monohybrid inheritance refers to the inheritance of a single trait (for example, flower color)
                    that is controlled by one gene with two alleles. It follows Mendel's laws of segregation and
                    dominance.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Cross between Pp (purple) × Pp (purple) results in offspring with a 3:1
                    ratio of purple to white flowers.</p>

                <h3>ii. Dihybrid Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Dihybrid inheritance involves two traits, each controlled by different genes. It demonstrates the
                    Law of Independent Assortment. When two traits are crossed, the offspring will inherit a
                    combination of alleles for both traits.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A cross between YyRr (yellow, round) × YyRr (yellow, round) will result
                    in a 9:3:3:1 ratio of combinations of yellow/green and round/wrinkled seeds.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Exceptions to Mendel’s Laws</h2>
                <p>While Mendel’s laws are foundational, there are several exceptions that modify the simple
                    patterns of inheritance:</p>

                <h3>i. Incomplete Dominance</h3>
                <p>Incomplete dominance occurs when the heterozygous phenotype is intermediate between the two
                    homozygous phenotypes, instead of one allele being completely dominant over the other.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> For flower color in some plants, if red (R) is crossed with white (W),
                    the offspring will be pink (RW), an intermediate between red and white.</p>

                <h3>ii. Co-dominance</h3>
                <p>Co-dominance occurs when both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype, and both alleles are
                    expressed simultaneously.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In human blood types, if a person inherits an A allele from one parent
                    and a B allele from the other, the resulting blood type will be AB, with both A and B antigens
                    expressed on the surface of red blood cells.</p>

                <h3>iii. Multiple Alleles</h3>
                <p>Some traits are controlled by more than two alleles, but an individual can have only two alleles
                    for a gene (one from each parent).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Human blood type is controlled by three alleles: A, B, and O. A person
                    can inherit two alleles, leading to four possible blood types: A, B, AB, or O.</p>

                <h3>iv. Polygenic Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Polygenic inheritance occurs when multiple genes contribute to a single trait, leading to a
                    continuous variation in the phenotype.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Traits like height or skin color in humans are controlled by multiple
                    genes, and their expression shows a range of possibilities.</p>

                <h3>v. Sex-linked Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Genes located on the X chromosome (in humans) exhibit sex-linked inheritance. Males (XY) are more
                    likely to express recessive X-linked traits because they have only one X chromosome.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Hemophilia and color blindness are X-linked recessive traits. Males who
                    inherit the X-linked recessive allele will express the disorder because they do not have a
                    second X chromosome to mask it.</p>

            <div class="molecular-basis-of-inheritance">
                <p>The molecular basis of inheritance refers to how genetic information is stored, transmitted, and
                    expressed within living organisms at the molecular level. This process involves DNA
                    (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is the carrier of genetic information, and the molecular
                    mechanisms that control its replication, transcription, translation, and the regulation of gene
                    expression.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Structure of DNA</h2>
                <p>DNA is the molecule responsible for carrying genetic information. Its structure is a double
                    helix, which was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, with input from Rosalind
                    Franklin.</p>

                <h3>Key Features of DNA Structure:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nucleotides:</strong> The basic building blocks of DNA, each consisting of a
                        phosphate group, a deoxyribose sugar, and a nitrogenous base.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bases:</strong> There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adenine (A)</li>
                            <li>Thymine (T)</li>
                            <li>Cytosine (C)</li>
                            <li>Guanine (G)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Base Pairing:</strong> The bases pair in a specific manner:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) (A-T)</li>
                            <li>Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) (C-G)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Double Helix:</strong> The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds
                        between complementary base pairs, forming a double helix structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antiparallel Orientation:</strong> The two strands of DNA run in opposite
                        directions, which is important for the replication process.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. DNA Replication</h2>
                <p>DNA replication is the process by which a cell copies its DNA before cell division. This ensures
                    that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic information.</p>

                <h3>Steps of DNA Replication:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unwinding of DNA:</strong> The enzyme helicase unwinds the double helix by breaking
                        the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, creating two single strands of DNA.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Formation of the Replication Fork:</strong> The unwinding of the DNA creates a
                        structure called the replication fork, where the two single strands of DNA are exposed for
                        replication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priming:</strong> RNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer, providing a starting
                        point for DNA polymerase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elongation:</strong> DNA polymerase adds new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand,
                        complementary to the template strand. On the leading strand, this occurs continuously, while
                        on the lagging strand, it occurs in short segments called Okazaki fragments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replacement of RNA Primer:</strong> The RNA primer is replaced with DNA by the
                        enzyme DNA polymerase I.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ligating the Strands:</strong> DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki
                        fragments, completing the formation of the new DNA strand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The process produces two identical double-stranded DNA molecules,
                        each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Transcription</h2>
                <p>Transcription is the process of converting a segment of DNA into RNA (specifically, messenger RNA
                    or mRNA), which carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome for protein
                    synthesis.</p>

                <h3>Steps of Transcription:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of the
                        gene and unwinds the DNA to expose the coding strand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elongation:</strong> RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand,
                        synthesizing a complementary strand of mRNA by adding RNA nucleotides (A, U, C, G) in the 5'
                        to 3' direction. (Note that in RNA, Uracil (U) replaces Thymine (T).)</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> When RNA polymerase reaches a terminator sequence on the DNA,
                        the transcription process stops, and the newly formed mRNA molecule is released.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Translation</h2>
                <p>Translation is the process by which mRNA is used to synthesize proteins at the ribosome. The mRNA
                    sequence is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that
                    folds into a functional protein.</p>

                <h3>Steps of Translation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The mRNA binds to the ribosome at the start codon (AUG), which
                        signals the beginning of protein synthesis. The first amino acid, methionine, is brought in
                        by the tRNA (transfer RNA), which has an anticodon complementary to the start codon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elongation:</strong> The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading the codons
                        (three-nucleotide sequences) and matching each codon with the appropriate tRNA carrying the
                        corresponding amino acid. The amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to form a
                        growing polypeptide chain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> When a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered, the
                        ribosome releases the newly synthesized protein, which then folds into its functional shape.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Genetic Code</h2>
                <p>The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in mRNA is translated into
                    proteins. It is made up of codons, which are groups of three nucleotides in mRNA that specify a
                    particular amino acid or a stop signal.</p>

                <h3>Key Features of the Genetic Code:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Universality:</strong> The genetic code is nearly universal, meaning it is the same
                        in almost all organisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Multiple codons can encode the same amino acid, which provides
                        some protection against mutations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Codon:</strong> The codon AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the start codon,
                        signaling the beginning of translation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop Codons:</strong> The codons UAA, UAG, and UGA signal the end of translation.
                    </li>

                <h2>vi. Regulation of Gene Expression</h2>
                <p>Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used to synthesize a
                    functional product, usually a protein. The regulation of gene expression allows cells to produce
                    the right proteins at the right time and in the right amounts.</p>

                <h3>Key Mechanisms of Gene Regulation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transcriptional Regulation:</strong> The amount of mRNA produced from a gene is
                        controlled by various factors, including transcription factors that bind to specific DNA
                        sequences to activate or repress transcription.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-transcriptional Regulation:</strong> After transcription, processes like RNA
                        splicing (removing introns and joining exons), mRNA stability, and RNA interference can
                        regulate the amount of mRNA available for translation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Translational Regulation:</strong> The initiation of translation can be regulated by
                        proteins that bind to mRNA and control the binding of the ribosome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-translational Regulation:</strong> After translation, proteins can be modified
                        through processes such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, or cleavage to become active or
                        inactive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>vii. Mutations</h2>
                <p>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can lead to changes in the protein produced. They
                    can occur naturally or be induced by environmental factors (mutagens).</p>

                <h3>Types of Mutations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Point Mutations:</strong> A single nucleotide change that can result in a silent
                        mutation (no change in the protein), a missense mutation (a different amino acid is
                        incorporated), or a nonsense mutation (a stop codon is introduced).</li>
                    <li><strong>Frameshift Mutations:</strong> Insertion or deletion of nucleotides that shift the
                        reading frame, altering the entire protein sequence downstream.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chromosomal Mutations:</strong> Larger-scale changes in the structure or number of
                        chromosomes, such as deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations.</li>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over time through variations in
                    traits and the inheritance of those traits. These changes accumulate across generations, leading
                    to the development of new species or the modification of existing ones. Evolution is driven by
                    natural processes such as natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Basic Concepts of Evolution</h2>

                <h3>i. Variation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variation refers to the differences that exist among individuals in a population. These
                        variations may be in physical traits, behaviors, or biochemical characteristics.</li>
                    <li>Variation arises due to mutations (changes in the DNA), genetic recombination during sexual
                        reproduction, and other genetic processes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ii. Heredity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heredity is the passing on of traits from parents to offspring. This ensures that beneficial
                        variations can be inherited and passed down to subsequent generations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iii. Adaptation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adaptation is the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment.
                        Traits that increase an organism’s chances of survival and reproduction become more common
                        in a population over time.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Theories of Evolution</h2>

                <h3>i. Lamarck's Theory of Evolution</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that organisms evolve by acquiring characteristics during
                        their lifetime due to environmental factors, and these acquired traits are passed on to
                        offspring.</li>
                    <li>He is famous for his theory of use and disuse, suggesting that parts of the body that are
                        used more frequently become more developed, while those that are not used deteriorate.</li>
                    <li>Example: Lamarck believed giraffes had long necks because their ancestors stretched their
                        necks to reach higher leaves and passed this acquired trait to their offspring.</li>
                    <li>Note: While Lamarck's theory is now discredited, it was one of the first attempts to explain
                        how species evolve.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ii. Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charles Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection based on his observations during his
                        voyage on the HMS Beagle. He concluded that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Individuals within a species are genetically varied.</li>
                            <li>In any given environment, some individuals are better adapted for survival than
                                others.</li>
                            <li>These individuals are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their favorable
                                traits to their offspring.</li>
                            <li>Over time, natural selection leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in a
                                population, which may result in the formation of new species.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Key Principles of Darwin’s Theory:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Overproduction: Organisms produce more offspring than can survive, leading to
                                competition for resources.</li>
                            <li>Variation: There are variations in traits among individuals in a population.</li>
                            <li>Struggle for Existence: Due to limited resources, individuals must compete for
                                survival.</li>
                            <li>Survival of the Fittest: Individuals with traits that are better suited to the
                                environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.</li>
                            <li>Natural Selection: Over generations, favorable traits become more common in the
                                population.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mechanisms of Evolution</h2>

                <h3>i. Natural Selection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural selection is the process where organisms with favorable traits are more likely to
                        survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to future generations.</li>
                    <li>Over time, this leads to the adaptation of organisms to their environment.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peppered Moth: During the Industrial Revolution, the dark-colored variety of the
                                peppered moth became more common than the light-colored variety because they were
                                better camouflaged against the soot-covered trees, avoiding predation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ii. Mutation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mutations are random changes in the DNA sequence that can create new traits in organisms.
                        While most mutations are neutral or harmful, some can be beneficial and increase an
                        organism’s chance of survival.</li>
                    <li>Mutations provide the genetic material upon which natural selection acts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iii. Genetic Drift</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies in a small population. It can
                        lead to the loss of genetic variation over time, especially in small populations.</li>
                    <li>Bottleneck Effect: A dramatic reduction in population size can lead to genetic drift, where
                        the gene pool is reduced, and genetic diversity is lost.</li>
                    <li>Founder Effect: A small group of individuals from a larger population establishes a new
                        population, and the gene pool may differ significantly from the original population.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iv. Gene Flow</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gene flow is the movement of alleles between populations through migration. When individuals
                        from different populations interbreed, genetic material is exchanged, increasing genetic
                        diversity in the population.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2> Evidence of Evolution</h2>

                <h3>i. Fossil Record</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The fossil record shows evidence of extinct species and the gradual changes in species over
                        time. Transitional fossils demonstrate intermediary forms between major groups of organisms,
                        showing evolutionary progression.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Archaeopteryx, a fossil showing features of both dinosaurs and birds, provides
                                evidence of the evolutionary link between reptiles and birds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ii. Comparative Anatomy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The comparison of anatomical structures between different species reveals both similarities
                        and differences that indicate common ancestry.</li>
                    <li>Homologous Structures: These are similar structures found in different species, indicating a
                        common ancestor (e.g., the forelimbs of humans, whales, and bats).</li>
                    <li>Analogous Structures: These are structures that have a similar function but evolved
                        independently in different species (e.g., the wings of birds and insects).</li>
                    <li>Vestigial Structures: These are remnants of organs that were functional in ancestors but
                        have no current function (e.g., the human appendix).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iii. Comparative Embryology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The study of embryos in different species shows that many species share similar
                        developmental stages, suggesting a common origin.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iv. Molecular Biology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The comparison of genetic material (DNA, RNA, and protein sequences) between species reveals
                        evolutionary relationships. Species that are more genetically similar are more closely
                        related.</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Humans and chimpanzees share about 98-99% of their DNA, indicating a recent common
                                ancestor.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2> Speciation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speciation is the process by which new species arise. It occurs when populations of a
                        species become reproductively isolated from one another, leading to the accumulation of
                        genetic differences.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>i. Types of Speciation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allopatric Speciation: When populations are geographically separated, leading to
                        reproductive isolation and genetic divergence.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A population of birds is divided by a mountain range, and over time, the
                                two groups evolve into different species.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sympatric Speciation: When new species arise within the same geographic area due to
                        reproductive isolation caused by factors such as behavioral differences, ecological niches,
                        or genetic mutations.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A group of fish in a lake evolves into two species that occupy different
                                depths or feeding habits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Parapatric Speciation: When populations are adjacent to each other but evolve into distinct
                        species due to environmental differences across their range.</li>

                    <li>Evolution does not follow a predetermined path but rather responds to environmental
                        pressures. Some trends observed in evolution include:</li>
                    <li>Adaptive Radiation: The rapid diversification of a species into multiple forms that occupy
                        different ecological niches.</li>
                    <li>Convergent Evolution: The process by which unrelated organisms evolve similar traits due to
                        similar environmental pressures.</li>
                    <li>Divergent Evolution: When two related species become more dissimilar due to different
                        environmental pressures.</li>

                <h2>Modern Evolutionary Synthesis</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The modern synthesis of evolution combines Darwin's theory of natural selection with modern
                        genetics. It emphasizes the role of genetic mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and
                        recombination in the evolution of species. This synthesis also highlights the role of
                        population genetics in understanding how evolutionary changes occur at the genetic level.
