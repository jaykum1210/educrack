                <h2>i. Organism</h2>
                <p>An organism is any individual living entity that can carry out all life processes independently.
                    It can range from unicellular organisms like bacteria to multicellular organisms like plants and
                    animals.</p>

                <h3>Types of Organisms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Unicellular:</b> Made of a single cell (e.g., bacteria, yeast).</li>
                    <li><b>Multicellular:</b> Composed of many cells with specialized functions (e.g., humans,
                        plants, animals).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Adaptations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organisms have evolved specific structures, behaviors, or physiological processes to survive
                        in their environment.</li>
                    <li>Example: The thick fur of polar bears helps them survive cold climates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Interactions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organisms interact with each other and the environment through various ecological processes
                        such as predation, competition, and symbiosis.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Population</h2>
                <p>A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same
                    time, capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring.</p>

                <h3>Population Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Density:</b> Number of individuals per unit area or volume. <i>Example: The density of
                            deer in a forest.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Dispersion:</b> The pattern of spacing of individuals within a population (clumped,
                        uniform, or random). <i>Example: Trees in a forest can be randomly dispersed, while wolves
                            in a pack may have uniform spacing.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Age Structure:</b> The distribution of individuals in different age groups (juvenile,
                        adult, and senile) affects the population's growth and reproduction.</li>
                    <li><b>Sex Ratio:</b> The proportion of males to females in a population, which can influence
                        reproductive rates.</li>
                    <li><b>Growth Rate:</b> The rate at which a population increases in size, determined by birth
                        rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Growth Models:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Exponential Growth:</b> Occurs when resources are abundant, and the population grows
                        rapidly.</li>
                    <li><b>Logistic Growth:</b> Occurs when resources become limited, and the growth rate slows down
                        as the population approaches the carrying capacity.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Factors Affecting Population Dynamics</h2>
                <h3>Abiotic Factors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-living factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and soil type that influence the
                        survival and distribution of organisms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Biotic Factors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Living factors such as competition, predation, and symbiosis that affect the population size
                        and structure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Carrying Capacity:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum number of individuals an environment can support without degrading the
                        ecosystem.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Birth and Death Rates:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Influence the population size and growth rate. High birth rates and low death rates result
                        in population growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Immigration and Emigration:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The movement of individuals into (immigration) or out of (emigration) a population affects
                        its size.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Population Interactions</h2>
                <p>Organisms within a population do not live in isolation. They interact with each other in several
                    ways, which affect their survival and reproduction.</p>

                <h3>Competition:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when individuals of the same or different species compete for limited resources like
                        food, water, and shelter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Predation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One organism (the predator) kills and eats another (the prey). This interaction regulates
                        population sizes of both predators and prey.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symbiosis:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A long-term interaction between two species that may benefit one or both.</li>
                    <li><b>Mutualism:</b> Both organisms benefit (e.g., bees and flowers).</li>
                    <li><b>Commensalism:</b> One organism benefits, and the other is neither helped nor harmed
                        (e.g., barnacles on whales).</li>
                    <li><b>Parasitism:</b> One organism benefits at the expense of the other (e.g., ticks on
                        mammals).</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The population grows at a constant rate, doubling in size over each time period.</li>
                    <li>Example: Bacterial growth under ideal conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Logistic Growth:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The population growth slows down as the population reaches the environment's carrying
                        capacity.</li>
                    <li>Example: A deer population in a forest will stop growing once resources (food, space) become
                        limited.</li>

                <h2>i. Ecosystem</h2>
                <p>An ecosystem is a dynamic community of living organisms (biotic components) interacting with
                    their physical environment (abiotic components). These interactions create a flow of energy and
                    cycling of nutrients within the ecosystem.</p>

                <h3>Components of an Ecosystem:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Abiotic Components:</b> Non-living factors such as air, water, soil, sunlight, and
                        temperature.</li>
                    <li><b>Biotic Components:</b> Living organisms in an ecosystem, including producers, consumers,
                        and decomposers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Organisms in an Ecosystem:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Producers (Autotrophs):</b> Organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis
                        (e.g., plants, algae).</li>
                    <li><b>Consumers (Heterotrophs):</b> Organisms that consume other organisms for food. They are
                        classified into:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Primary Consumers:</b> Herbivores that eat plants (e.g., deer).</li>
                            <li><b>Secondary Consumers:</b> Carnivores that eat herbivores (e.g., wolves).</li>
                            <li><b>Tertiary Consumers:</b> Apex predators that eat secondary consumers (e.g.,
                                lions).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Decomposers (Detritivores):</b> Organisms like fungi and bacteria that break down dead
                        organisms and recycle nutrients into the environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Energy Flow in Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Energy in an ecosystem flows in one direction, from the sun to producers and then to various
                    consumers, and ultimately to decomposers. Energy cannot be recycled and is lost at each trophic
                    level.</p>

                <h3>Source of Energy:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The primary source of energy for most ecosystems is sunlight.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Photosynthesis:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plants, algae, and some bacteria capture solar energy and convert it into chemical energy in
                        the form of glucose.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Trophic Levels:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Producers:</b> The first trophic level, where plants and algae convert sunlight into
                        energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Consumers:</b> Organisms that consume producers or other consumers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary Consumers: Herbivores that eat producers.</li>
                            <li>Secondary Consumers: Carnivores that eat herbivores.</li>

                <h2>iii. Food Chain and Food Web</h2>
                <h3>Food Chain:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A linear sequence showing the flow of energy from one organism to another. Each step in the
                        food chain is called a "trophic level."</li>
                    <li>Example: Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Food Web:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A more complex and realistic model showing how multiple food chains are interconnected in an
                        ecosystem. It shows the various feeding relationships between organisms.</li>
                    <li>Example: In a forest, multiple species of plants, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers
                        form an intricate food web.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>iv. Energy Pyramid</h2>
                <p>An Energy Pyramid represents the energy available at each trophic level in an ecosystem. Primary
                    Producers (plants) at the base have the highest energy, while energy decreases as you move up
                    each trophic level.</p>

                <h3>10% Rule:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only about 10% of the energy is passed on to the next trophic level, while the rest is lost
                        as heat or used for metabolism.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Energy Pyramid Example:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Trophic Level 1:</b> Primary producers (plants) → highest energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Trophic Level 2:</b> Primary consumers (herbivores) → 10% of the energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Trophic Level 3:</b> Secondary consumers (carnivores) → 1% of the energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Trophic Level 4:</b> Tertiary consumers (top predators) → 0.1% of the energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Nutrient Cycling</h2>
                <p>Nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycle through ecosystems in a process known as
                    biogeochemical cycling. Decomposers play a key role in breaking down organic matter and
                    recycling nutrients back into the environment for use by producers.</p>

                <h3>Types of Nutrient Cycles:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Carbon Cycle:</b> Involves the movement of carbon through the atmosphere, producers,
                        consumers, and decomposers.</li>
