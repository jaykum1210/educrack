            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy,
                    producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. It takes place in the chloroplasts
                    of plant cells and involves two main stages: light reactions and dark reactions (also known as
                    the Calvin Cycle). Additionally, there are two main types of photosynthetic pathways: C3 pathway
                    and C4 pathway.</p>

                <p>Occurs in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.</p>

                <h3>Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The light reactions are light-dependent, meaning they require sunlight to proceed.</li>
                    <li>When chlorophyll absorbs light energy, it excites electrons, initiating a series of events.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Photolysis:</strong> Water molecules are split into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and
                        electrons (e⁻). The oxygen is released as a byproduct.</li>
                    <li>The excited electrons travel through the electron transport chain (ETC), generating a flow
                        of energy.</li>
                    <li>ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) are
                        produced by the light reactions and are used in the dark reactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Products:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ATP:</strong> Energy carrier molecule.</li>
                    <li><strong>NADPH:</strong> Reducing agent used in the dark reactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oxygen (O₂):</strong> Released as a byproduct from the splitting of water.</li>

                <h2>ii. Dark Reactions (Calvin Cycle / Light-Independent Reactions)</h2>
                <h3>Location:</h3>
                <p>Occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts (fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoid
                    membranes).</p>

                <h3>Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The dark reactions do not require light directly but depend on the ATP and NADPH produced in
                        the light reactions.</li>
                    <li>The primary purpose of the dark reactions is to fix carbon dioxide (CO₂) into an organic
                        molecule (usually glucose).</li>
                    <li>The Calvin Cycle consists of a series of enzyme-controlled steps that convert carbon dioxide
                        into glucose.</li>
                    <li>The key enzyme involved is RuBisCO (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase), which
                        catalyzes the fixation of CO₂ onto ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), resulting in the formation
                        of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).</li>
                    <li>Through several steps, 3-PGA is reduced to form G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), which can
                        be used to produce glucose and other carbohydrates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Products:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glucose:</strong> The primary sugar produced, which can be used immediately for
                        energy or stored as starch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other carbohydrates:</strong> These can be used for plant growth and development.

                <h2>iii. C3 Pathway (The Calvin Cycle)</h2>
                <h3>Location:</h3>
                <p>Occurs in the mesophyll cells of leaves.</p>

                <h3>Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the C3 pathway, carbon dioxide (CO₂) is fixed directly by RuBisCO in the Calvin Cycle to
                        form a 3-carbon compound (3-phosphoglycerate, 3-PGA), which is then converted into G3P.</li>
                    <li>The name "C3" comes from the fact that the first stable product of CO₂ fixation is a
                        3-carbon molecule.</li>
                    <li>This pathway is most common in temperate plants and plants that thrive in moderate climates.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient in moderate temperatures and when there is sufficient water.</li>
                    <li>It requires less energy than C4 and CAM pathways.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inefficient under high temperatures and low CO₂ concentrations due to photorespiration (when
                        RuBisCO binds to oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, wasting energy and reducing sugar
                        production).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wheat, rice, and most trees.</li>

                <h2>iv. C4 Pathway</h2>
                <h3>Location:</h3>
                <p>Occurs in mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells of leaves.</p>

                <h3>Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The C4 pathway involves an additional step before the Calvin Cycle. CO₂ is initially fixed
                        into a 4-carbon compound, usually oxaloacetate, in the mesophyll cells by the enzyme PEP
                        carboxylase (which has a higher affinity for CO₂ than RuBisCO).</li>
                    <li>The 4-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath cells, where it is converted
                        back into CO₂, which enters the Calvin Cycle for glucose production.</li>
                    <li>This separation of carbon fixation and the Calvin Cycle into different cells reduces the
                        chances of photorespiration, making it more efficient at higher temperatures and lower CO₂
                        concentrations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>More efficient in hot and dry climates.</li>
                    <li>Less photorespiration, as CO₂ is concentrated around RuBisCO, leading to higher sugar
                        production.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires more energy (ATP) than the C3 pathway.</li>
                    <li>More complex than the C3 pathway.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>The Krebs cycle occurs after glycolysis if oxygen is available (aerobic conditions). It

                <h3>Steps in the Krebs Cycle:</h3>
                <h4>Formation of Acetyl-CoA:</h4>
                <p>Pyruvate (3 carbons) is decarboxylated (one carbon is removed as CO₂) to form Acetyl-CoA (2
                    carbons). This step also produces 1 NADH.</p>

                <h4>Citric Acid Formation:</h4>
                <p>Acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) combines with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to form citric acid (6 carbons).
                </p>

                <h4>Series of Reactions:</h4>
                <p>Citric acid undergoes a series of reactions where it loses 2 carbon atoms as CO₂ and is gradually
                    oxidized, producing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 NADH.</li>
                    <li>1 FADH₂ (another electron carrier).</li>
                    <li>1 ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Regeneration of Oxaloacetate:</h4>
                <p>The cycle ends by regenerating oxaloacetate, enabling the cycle to repeat with another molecule
                    of Acetyl-CoA.</p>

                        process, requiring oxygen.</li>

                        deliver electrons to the ETC, which is a series of protein complexes and other molecules

                <h3>Steps in the ETC:</h3>
                <h4>Electron Donation:</h4>
                <p>NADH and FADH₂ donate their electrons to the electron transport chain. NADH donates electrons to
                    Complex I, and FADH₂ donates electrons to Complex II.</p>

                <h4>Electron Transfer:</h4>
                <p>The electrons move through the complexes in the ETC (Complex I, II, III, IV) via a series of
                    redox reactions, releasing energy at each step. This energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) from
                    the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.</p>

                <h4>Oxygen as the Final Electron Acceptor:</h4>
                <p>Oxygen (O₂) acts as the final electron acceptor at Complex IV, combining with electrons and
                    protons to form water (H₂O).</p>

                <h4>ATP Synthesis:</h4>
                <p>The electrochemical gradient created by proton pumping across the membrane drives protons back
                    into the matrix through ATP synthase. The flow of protons through ATP synthase provides the
                    energy for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, a process known as oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
