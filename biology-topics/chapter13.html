            <h1 id="Muscle">1.Muscle Types and Movement</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Muscles are specialized tissues responsible for producing movement in the body. They are divided
                    into three main types: skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles. Each muscle type
                    has unique characteristics, functions, and locations within the body. Understanding these types
                    and how they produce movement is essential in human physiology.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Skeletal Muscle</h2>
                <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Skeletal muscles are striated (striped) because they have a regular
                    arrangement of muscle fibers. They are long, cylindrical fibers with multiple nuclei located at
                    the periphery of the cells.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> These muscles are attached to bones by tendons and are responsible for
                    voluntary movements.</p>
                <p><strong>Control:</strong> Skeletal muscles are voluntary, meaning they are controlled consciously
                    by the central nervous system (CNS).</p>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong> Skeletal muscles enable the body to move, maintain posture, and
                    generate heat. They work in pairs or groups to produce coordinated movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Biceps, triceps, quadriceps, and hamstrings.</p>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> When skeletal muscles contract, they generate force, pulling bones at
                    the joints. For example, when the biceps contract, they cause flexion of the elbow, while the
                    triceps cause extension.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Smooth Muscle</h2>
                <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Smooth muscles are non-striated (lack the striped appearance). The
                    muscle fibers are spindle-shaped, and each cell has a single nucleus. They contract slowly and
                    rhythmically.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach, intestines,
                    bladder, blood vessels, and airways.</p>
                <p><strong>Control:</strong> Smooth muscles are involuntary, meaning they are controlled
                    automatically by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, and local chemical signals.</p>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong> Smooth muscles regulate the movement of substances through hollow
                    organs (e.g., food through the digestive system) and help control blood flow and air passage.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Muscles in the intestines (peristalsis), muscles in blood vessels
                    (vasoconstriction/vasodilation), and muscles in the bladder.</p>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> Smooth muscle contractions are slow and sustained. For example, in the
                    digestive system, smooth muscles help move food along the gastrointestinal tract through a
                    process called peristalsis.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Cardiac Muscle</h2>
                <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Cardiac muscles are striated like skeletal muscles but are branched
                    and interconnected. Each cardiac muscle cell contains a single nucleus, and the fibers are
                    joined by intercalated discs, which help synchronize contractions.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Found exclusively in the walls of the heart.</p>
                <p><strong>Control:</strong> Cardiac muscles are involuntary and controlled by the autonomic nervous
                    system as well as pacemaker cells in the heart.</p>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong> Cardiac muscles are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body
                    by contracting and relaxing in a coordinated rhythm.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The heart muscle (myocardium).</p>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> The heart contracts rhythmically to pump blood. This contraction,
                    called a heartbeat, ensures blood is pumped to the lungs and the rest of the body.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Muscle Movements</h2>
                <p>Movement in the body occurs when muscles contract and shorten, pulling on bones or tissues.
                    Muscle movements can be categorized into the following:</p>

                <h3>Flexion and Extension:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexion:</strong> A bending movement that decreases the angle between two body parts
                        (e.g., bending the elbow).</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> A straightening movement that increases the angle between two
                        body parts (e.g., straightening the elbow).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Abduction and Adduction:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abduction:</strong> Movement of a body part away from the midline of the body (e.g.,
                        raising the arms sideways).</li>
                    <li><strong>Adduction:</strong> Movement of a body part toward the midline of the body (e.g.,
                        lowering the arms back to the sides).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Rotation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medial rotation:</strong> Turning a body part inward (e.g., rotating the arm so the
                        palm faces backward).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lateral rotation:</strong> Turning a body part outward (e.g., rotating the arm so
                        the palm faces forward).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pronation and Supination:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pronation:</strong> Rotating the forearm so that the palm faces downward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supination:</strong> Rotating the forearm so that the palm faces upward.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Plantar Flexion and Dorsiflexion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plantar flexion:</strong> Pointing the toes downward (e.g., pressing the gas pedal
                        in a car).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dorsiflexion:</strong> Pulling the toes upward (e.g., standing on heels).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Circumduction:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Circular movement:</strong> Circular movement at a joint, such as moving the arm in
                        a circular motion.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Muscle Contraction Mechanism</h2>
                <p>The process of muscle contraction is explained through the sliding filament theory. Here's how it
                    works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activation:</strong> A nerve impulse from the central nervous system triggers the
                        release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which then stimulates the muscle
                        fiber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calcium Release:</strong> The impulse travels into the muscle fiber, causing the
                        release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Bridge Formation:</strong> Calcium binds to troponin on the actin filament,
                        causing a shift in the tropomyosin and allowing the myosin heads to attach to actin, forming
                        cross-bridges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sliding of Filaments:</strong> The myosin heads pull the actin filaments towards the
                        center of the sarcomere, causing the muscle to contract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relaxation:</strong> After the impulse stops, calcium ions are pumped back into the
                        sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the muscle fiber relaxes.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1 id="Neurons">2. Neurons, Synapse, and Reflex Action</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The nervous system is responsible for coordinating and regulating all body functions, allowing an
                    organism to respond to internal and external stimuli. The neurons, synapse, and reflex action
                    are crucial components of this system. Below is a breakdown of these concepts:</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Neurons (Nerve Cells)</h2>
                <p>Neurons are the functional units of the nervous system, responsible for transmitting electrical
                    impulses. They can be classified based on their function and structure.</p>

                <h3>Structure of Neuron:</h3>
                <p>A typical neuron consists of three main parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cell Body (Soma):</strong> Contains the nucleus and other organelles, responsible
                        for the metabolic activities of the neuron.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dendrites:</strong> Branched extensions that receive electrical signals from other
                        neurons and transmit them towards the cell body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Axon:</strong> A long, cylindrical extension that carries electrical impulses away
                        from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. The axon is often covered by a
                        fatty insulating layer called the myelin sheath that speeds up the transmission of nerve
                        impulses.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of Neurons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sensory Neurons (Afferent Neurons):</strong> Transmit sensory information from
                        sensory receptors to the central nervous system (CNS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Motor Neurons (Efferent Neurons):</strong> Carry impulses from the CNS to muscles
                        and glands, triggering responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interneurons:</strong> Located in the CNS, they transmit impulses between sensory
                        and motor neurons, enabling communication within the nervous system.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Function of Neurons:</h3>
                <p>Neurons transmit electrical signals (nerve impulses) through action potentials, which move along
                    the axon and are transmitted across synapses to other neurons or target cells. The transmission
                    of these signals enables quick responses to stimuli, integration of sensory inputs, and
                    regulation of bodily functions.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Synapse</h2>
                <p>A synapse is the junction or gap between two neurons, where communication occurs through the
                    transmission of chemical signals.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Structure of a Synapse:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Presynaptic Terminal:</strong> The end of the axon of the transmitting neuron, which
                        contains neurotransmitters (chemical messengers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Synaptic Cleft:</strong> The small gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic
                        neurons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Postsynaptic Membrane:</strong> The membrane of the receiving neuron or target cell

                <h3>Function of Synapse:</h3>
                <p>When an electrical impulse (action potential) reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release
                    of neurotransmitters (such as dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine) into the synaptic cleft. These
                    neurotransmitters cross the synapse and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane,
                    generating a new electrical signal in the receiving neuron. Synapses allow communication between
                    neurons, which is essential for processes like reflexes, thought, and memory formation.</p>

                <h3>Types of Synapses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Synapse:</strong> The most common type, where neurotransmitters are
                        released to transmit signals across the synaptic cleft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical Synapse:</strong> Less common, where neurons are connected by gap
                        junctions, allowing direct electrical signal transmission.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>iii. Reflex Action</h2>
                <p>A reflex action is an automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus that does not require the
                    involvement of the brain. Reflex actions help protect the body from harm and are faster than
                    voluntary responses.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Structure of Reflex Arc:</h3>
                <p>The reflex arc is the pathway taken by the nerve impulses during a reflex action. It involves the
                    following components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Receptor:</strong> A sensory organ or nerve ending that detects a stimulus (e.g.,
                        heat, pain).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensory Neuron:</strong> Carries the impulse from the receptor to the spinal cord
                        (CNS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interneuron:</strong> In the spinal cord, the interneuron processes the sensory
                        information and sends a response to the motor neuron.</li>
                    <li><strong>Motor Neuron:</strong> Carries the impulse from the spinal cord to an effector
                        (e.g., a muscle or gland).</li>
                    <li><strong>Effector:</strong> The muscle or gland that responds to the stimulus (e.g., muscle
                        contraction, gland secretion).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Example of Reflex Action:</h3>
                <p><strong>Withdrawal Reflex:</strong> If you touch something hot, sensory receptors in your skin
                    detect the heat and send an impulse via a sensory neuron to the spinal cord. The impulse is
                    processed, and a motor neuron sends a signal to the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling
                    your hand away from the hot object. This entire process happens before the pain sensation
                    reaches the brain.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of Reflexes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monosynaptic Reflex:</strong> Involves only one synapse between the sensory and
                        motor neuron, e.g., the knee-jerk reflex.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polysynaptic Reflex:</strong> Involves more than one synapse, including
                        interneurons, e.g., the withdrawal reflex.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Significance of Reflex Actions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reflexes provide a rapid response to a stimulus, helping the body protect itself from
                        injury.</li>
                    <li>Reflex actions can also help maintain balance, posture, and certain autonomic functions like
                        heart rate and digestion.</li>
