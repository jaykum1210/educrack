        <div class="topic-name">
            <div class="circulatory-system">
                <p>The human circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood, nutrients, oxygen, carbon
                    dioxide, hormones, and other substances throughout the body. It is essential for maintaining
                    homeostasis and supporting the functions of various organs and tissues.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Human Circulatory System</h2>
                <p>The circulatory system is a complex network of blood vessels and organs that ensure the
                    distribution of blood to various parts of the body. It consists of two major circuits: the
                    pulmonary circuit and the systemic circuit.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Major Components of the Circulatory System:</h2>

                <h3>Heart:</h3>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong> The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system. It acts
                    as a pump to circulate blood through the body. The heart consists of four chambers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right Atrium:</strong> Receives deoxygenated blood from the body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right Ventricle:</strong> Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation
                        (pulmonary circulation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Left Atrium:</strong> Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Left Ventricle:</strong> Pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body
                        (systemic circulation).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The heart is divided by a septum into two halves, each with an atrium and a ventricle.</p>

                <h3>Blood Vessels:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart (except the
                        pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood). Arteries have thick muscular walls
                        to withstand high pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Veins:</strong> Carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart (except the pulmonary
                        vein, which carries oxygenated blood). Veins have thinner walls than arteries and
                        contain valves to prevent the backflow of blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Capillaries:</strong> Tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. They
                        are the sites of gas and nutrient exchange between the blood and body tissues. The walls
                        of capillaries are one cell thick, allowing for easy diffusion of gases (oxygen and
                        carbon dioxide), nutrients, and waste products.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Blood:</h3>
                <p>Blood is the medium through which substances are transported throughout the body. It is made
                    up of cells and plasma, and its composition plays a vital role in the body's overall
                    function.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Circulation Pathways</h2>
                <h3>i. Pulmonary Circulation:</h3>
                <p>This circuit involves the movement of blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the
                    lungs, where it is oxygenated, and then back to the left atrium of the heart.</p>
                <p><strong>Path:</strong> Right Ventricle → Pulmonary Artery → Lungs → Pulmonary Vein → Left
                    Atrium.</p>

                <h3>ii. Systemic Circulation:</h3>
                <p>This circuit involves the movement of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of
                    the body and the return of deoxygenated blood to the right atrium.</p>
                <p><strong>Path:</strong> Left Ventricle → Aorta → Arteries → Capillaries (in tissues) → Veins →
                    Superior/Inferior Vena Cava → Right Atrium.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Blood Composition</h2>
                <p>Blood is composed of two main components: Plasma (the liquid part) and Formed Elements (the
                    cellular part). These components perform different functions crucial for the body's health.
                </p>

                <h3>i. Plasma (55% of blood volume):</h3>
                <p>Plasma is a yellowish liquid that serves as a medium for transporting blood cells, nutrients,
                    gases, hormones, and waste products.</p>
                <h4>Composition of Plasma:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water (about 90%):</strong> It is the primary solvent in plasma and helps in the
                        transport of nutrients, gases, and waste products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proteins (about 7-8%):</strong> Key proteins include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Albumin: Helps maintain osmotic pressure and blood volume.</li>
                            <li>Globulins: Involved in immune responses (e.g., antibodies).</li>
                            <li>Fibrinogen: Involved in blood clotting.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Electrolytes:</strong> Sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate
                        help in maintaining the body’s acid-base balance and osmotic pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids are
                        transported to cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gases:</strong> Oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported, though most oxygen is
                        carried by red blood cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Products:</strong> Urea, creatinine, and bilirubin are carried to the
                        kidneys for excretion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ii. Formed Elements (45% of blood volume):</h3>
                <p>The formed elements of blood consist of cells and cell fragments.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Red Blood Cells (RBCs) (Erythrocytes):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Function:</strong> RBCs are primarily responsible for transporting oxygen from
                        the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> RBCs are biconcave discs that lack a nucleus, which allows
                        more space for hemoglobin (the protein that binds oxygen).</li>
                    <li><strong>Life Span:</strong> Approximately 120 days; they are produced in the bone marrow
                        and broken down in the liver and spleen.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>White Blood Cells (WBCs) (Leukocytes):</h3>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong> WBCs are involved in immune responses and defense against
                    infections and foreign invaders.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of WBCs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neutrophils:</strong> First responders to infections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong> Involved in the immune response (B-cells and T-cells).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Monocytes:</strong> Turn into macrophages and help in phagocytosis (engulfing
                        pathogens).</li>
                    <li><strong>Eosinophils:</strong> Fight parasitic infections and are involved in allergic
                        reactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basophils:</strong> Release histamine during inflammatory responses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Life Span:</strong> Varies depending on the type of WBC, from a few days to years (in
                    the case of memory cells).</p>

                <h3>Platelets (Thrombocytes):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Function:</strong> Platelets are involved in blood clotting. They help form a
                        plug at the site of injury to prevent blood loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Platelets are small, irregularly shaped cell fragments
                        derived from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Life Span:</strong> About 7-10 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Blood Clotting Mechanism</h2>
                <p>When a blood vessel is injured, a blood clot is formed to stop bleeding. This process
                    involves several steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vasoconstriction:</strong> Blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platelet Plug Formation:</strong> Platelets adhere to the site of injury and
                        release chemicals to attract more platelets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coagulation:</strong> Clotting factors (proteins in plasma) form a fibrin mesh
                        that traps blood cells and forms a stable clot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clot Retraction and Repair:</strong> The clot contracts to help reduce the wound
                        size, and tissue repair begins.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1 id="Excretory">2. Excretory System: Urine Formation and Kidney Function</h1>
            <div class="excretory-system">
                <p>The excretory system is responsible for removing metabolic waste products and maintaining
                    homeostasis within the body, particularly in terms of water balance, ion concentration, and
                    pH. The kidneys play a central role in this system by filtering blood, removing waste, and
                    producing urine.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>1. Overview of the Excretory System</h2>
                <p>The excretory system includes several organs and structures that work together to eliminate
                    waste products from the body and regulate water and electrolyte balance. These organs
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kidneys:</strong> Main organs that filter blood and form urine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ureters:</strong> Tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bladder:</strong> Stores urine until it is excreted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urethra:</strong> The tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of
                        the body.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>2. Kidney Structure and Function</h2>
                <p>Each kidney is a bean-shaped organ located in the abdominal cavity, and each kidney consists
                    of two main parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outer cortex:</strong> The outer region where blood filtration begins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner medulla:</strong> Contains structures like the renal pyramids that help in
                        the final stages of urine formation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. Each kidney contains about 1 million
                    nephrons, which are responsible for filtering blood and producing urine.</p>

                <h3>Structure of a Nephron:</h3>
                <p>The nephron is composed of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Renal corpuscle:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bowman's capsule:</strong> A cup-like structure that encases the
                                glomerulus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Glomerulus:</strong> A network of capillaries where filtration of blood
                                occurs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Renal tubule:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT):</strong> The first segment of the
                                renal tubule, where most reabsorption of water, ions, and nutrients occurs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loop of Henle:</strong> A U-shaped tube that plays a key role in
                                creating a concentration gradient in the kidney.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distal convoluted tubule (DCT):</strong> Further reabsorption of ions
                                occurs here, and the final adjustment of urine composition is made.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collecting duct:</strong> Receives urine from multiple nephrons and
                                moves it to the renal pelvis.</li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>3. Urine Formation</h2>
                <p>Urine formation involves three main processes: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.</p>

                <h3>1. Glomerular Filtration:</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Takes place in the glomerulus.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Blood entering the kidney through the renal artery is filtered
                    under high pressure as it passes through the glomerulus. The filtered fluid, called
                    glomerular filtrate, consists of water, ions, glucose, amino acids, and metabolic waste
                    products (e.g., urea). However, large proteins and blood cells do not pass through the
                    filtration barrier.</p>
                <p><strong>Filtration Rate:</strong> The rate at which the kidneys filter blood is called the
                    glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A healthy GFR is crucial for maintaining proper kidney
                    function.</p>

                <h3>2. Tubular Reabsorption:</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Occurs mainly in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), the loop of
                    Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT).</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> After filtration, most of the water and useful substances (such as
                    glucose, amino acids, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate) are reabsorbed into the blood.
                    This occurs through active and passive transport mechanisms in the renal tubules.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs the majority of these substances.</li>
                    <li>The loop of Henle creates a concentration gradient that allows the kidneys to conserve
                        water.</li>
                    <li>The distal convoluted tubule fine-tunes the reabsorption of ions, like sodium and
                        calcium, and helps regulate pH.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Selective Reabsorption:</strong> Not all filtrates are reabsorbed. For example, urea
                    and creatinine remain in the filtrate and are excreted as waste.</p>

                <h3>3. Tubular Secretion:</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Occurs mainly in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Certain substances are actively secreted from the blood into the
                    filtrate, such as hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonium, and creatinine. This helps
                    regulate the pH of the blood and remove additional waste products that are not filtered at
                    the glomerulus.</p>

                <h3>4. Water Reabsorption and Concentration of Urine:</h3>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Occurs in the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and
                    collecting duct.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> As the filtrate moves through the nephron, water is reabsorbed
                    based on the body's needs. In the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed by the countercurrent
                    mechanism, which helps concentrate the urine and conserve water. The final concentration of
                    urine is determined in the collecting duct, where water reabsorption is regulated by
                    hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH).</p>

                <h3>5. Excretion of Urine:</h3>
                <p>Once the urine is formed, it flows from the collecting ducts into the renal pelvis, then into
                    the ureter, and is stored in the bladder until excretion through the urethra.</p>

                <h2>4. Kidney Functions</h2>
                <p>The kidneys perform several important functions to maintain homeostasis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Filtration of Blood:</strong> The kidneys filter about 180 liters of blood
                        daily, removing excess substances, waste products, and toxins while retaining essential
                        nutrients like glucose and amino acids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation of Fluid and Electrolyte Balance:</strong> The kidneys help maintain
                        the balance of water and electrolytes (like sodium, potassium, calcium) in the body.
                        This regulation is essential for nerve function, muscle contraction, and maintaining
                        blood pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acid-Base Balance:</strong> The kidneys help maintain the body's pH by excreting
                        hydrogen ions (H⁺) and reabsorbing bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) to keep the blood's pH within the
                        optimal range (around 7.4).</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation of Blood Pressure:</strong> Through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
                        system (RAAS), the kidneys help regulate blood pressure by adjusting the amount of
                        sodium and water excreted. This controls blood volume and vascular resistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Erythropoiesis Regulation:</strong> The kidneys produce the hormone
                        erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone
                        marrow in response to low oxygen levels in the blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detoxification:</strong> The kidneys filter and excrete metabolic waste products
                        like urea, creatinine, and uric acid, as well as drugs and toxins, helping to detoxify
                        the body.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Disorders of the Excretory System</h2>
                <p>Several disorders can affect kidney function and the formation of urine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):</strong> Progressive loss of kidney function due
                        to conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or glomerulonephritis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):</strong> Sudden loss of kidney function, often caused
                        by infection, dehydration, or drug toxicity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> Hard deposits of minerals and salts that form in the
                        kidneys, causing pain and blockage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Infections of the urinary system,
                        including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nephrotic Syndrome:</strong> A condition where the kidneys leak excessive
                        protein into the urine, leading to swelling and other complications.</li>
