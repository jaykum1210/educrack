            <h1 id="cell-theory">1. Cell Theory</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The Cell Theory is one of the fundamental principles in biology that explains the structure and
                    function of cells in living organisms. It provides a conceptual framework for understanding the
                    organization and functioning of life at the cellular level. The theory has three main
                    principles:</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>All living organisms are made up of cells.</h2>
                <p>This principle states that all forms of life, from the simplest bacteria to the most complex
                    multicellular organisms, are composed of one or more cells. Cells are considered the basic
                    structural and functional units of life.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in living organisms.</h2>
                <p>The cell is the smallest unit of life capable of carrying out all necessary life functions such
                    as metabolism, reproduction, response to stimuli, and homeostasis. In multicellular organisms,
                    cells work together to form tissues, organs, and systems, but each cell still maintains its
                    individual functions and characteristics.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>All cells arise from pre-existing cells.</h2>
                <p>This principle, formulated by Rudolf Virchow in 1855, states that cells cannot spontaneously
                    arise. Instead, they are produced by the division of existing cells. This concept disputes the
                    theory of spontaneous generation (the idea that living organisms can arise from non-living
                    matter) and supports the idea of cell division as the basis for new cell formation.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Historical Development of Cell Theory</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Robert Hooke (1665):</strong> First observed and coined the term “cell” after
                        examining a thin slice of cork under a microscope. He saw small, box-like structures and
                        referred to them as "cells" because they resembled the small rooms (cells) in a monastery.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1674):</strong> Using his improved microscope, he observed
                        living cells, such as bacteria and protozoa, in pond water, making significant contributions
                        to the understanding of cellular life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Matthias Schleiden (1838):</strong> Proposed that all plant tissues are composed of
                        cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Theodor Schwann (1839):</strong> Extended Schleiden's work to animals, stating that
                        all living organisms, both plants and animals, are made up of cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rudolf Virchow (1855):</strong> Stated that cells arise from pre-existing cells,
                        adding the final principle to the cell theory.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Importance of the Cell Theory</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It forms the foundation of modern biology and provides a unifying concept for the study of
                        living organisms.</li>
                    <li>It emphasizes the essential role of cells in biological functions, including metabolism,
                        reproduction, and genetic inheritance.</li>
                    <li>Understanding the cellular basis of life has led to advances in areas such as medicine,
                        genetics, and biotechnology.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Exceptions to Cell Theory</h3>
                <p>While cell theory is a universally accepted principle in biology, there are a few exceptions,
                    including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Viruses are not made up of cells. They consist of a protein coat
                        and genetic material (either DNA or RNA). They cannot carry out metabolic processes on their
                        own and require a host cell to reproduce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mitochondria and Chloroplasts:</strong> These organelles within eukaryotic cells
                        have their own DNA and can replicate independently, suggesting they may have originated from
                        independent prokaryotic cells through an evolutionary process known as endosymbiosis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Differences:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> Prokaryotic cells do not have a membrane-bound nucleus. Their
                        genetic material is found in a region called the nucleoid. Eukaryotic cells have a
                        membrane-bound nucleus that contains the cell's genetic material (DNA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Organelles:</strong> Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria,
                        endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Eukaryotes have complex membrane-bound
                        organelles, allowing for compartmentalization of cellular functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNA:</strong> Prokaryotic cells contain a single, circular DNA molecule that floats
                        freely in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic cells have multiple linear chromosomes contained within
                        the nucleus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cell Division:</strong> Prokaryotes reproduce through binary fission, where the DNA
                        is copied and the cell divides into two identical daughter cells. Eukaryotes divide through
                        mitosis for growth or asexual reproduction and meiosis for sexual reproduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Prokaryotic cells are smaller (1–10 micrometers) and simpler in
                        structure. Eukaryotic cells are larger (10–100 micrometers) and more complex, containing
                        many specialized organelles.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Similarities Between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both contain ribosomes for protein synthesis.</li>
                    <li>Both have a plasma membrane that regulates the movement of substances in and out of the

            <h1 id="structure">3. Structure of Plant and Animal Cells</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Both plant and animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have membrane-bound organelles and a
                    defined nucleus. However, they differ in their structures and certain organelles due to their
                    specific functions. Here's a comparison of the structures found in plant and animal cells:</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Common Features of Plant and Animal Cells</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Membrane:</strong> Both plant and animal cells have a plasma membrane that
                        encloses the cell and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> Both cell types contain cytoplasm, a jelly-like substance where
                        various cell organelles are suspended. It aids in the movement of materials around the cell.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> Both have a nucleus that contains the cell's DNA. The nucleus
                        controls the cell's activities, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It is
                        enclosed by a nuclear membrane and contains nucleolus, which is involved in ribosome
                        production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> Both cells have mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell,
                        where cellular respiration occurs to produce energy (ATP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> Ribosomes are present in both plant and animal cells,
                        responsible for protein synthesis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</strong> Both have rough ER (with ribosomes) and smooth
                        ER (without ribosomes). Rough ER is involved in protein synthesis, while smooth ER is
                        involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golgi Apparatus:</strong> Both plant and animal cells contain a Golgi apparatus,
                        which modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lysosomes:</strong> Lysosomes are present mainly in animal cells and help break down
                        waste material. They contain digestive enzymes.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Plant Cell Structure</h2>
                <p>In addition to the common organelles shared with animal cells, plant cells have certain
                    specialized structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cell Wall:</strong> The cell wall is present in plant cells, providing structural
                        support and rigidity. It is made of cellulose and helps maintain the shape of the plant
                        cell. It also acts as a protective barrier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> Plant cells contain chloroplasts, which are involved in
                        photosynthesis. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy
                        for converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Central Vacuole:</strong> The vacuole is large and central in plant cells. It
                        contains cell sap, which is a mixture of water, salts, sugars, and other substances. The
                        vacuole helps maintain turgor pressure, provides structural support, and stores nutrients
                        and waste products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plasmodesmata:</strong> Plasmodesmata are channels between plant cells that allow
                        for the exchange of materials and communication between adjacent cells.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Animal Cell Structure</h2>
                <p>In addition to the common organelles shared with plant cells, animal cells have certain
                    specialized structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lysosomes:</strong> Lysosomes in animal cells contain digestive enzymes that break
                        down waste materials, cellular debris, and foreign particles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Centrioles:</strong> Centrioles are found in animal cells and are involved in cell
                        division (mitosis and meiosis). They help in organizing microtubules to form the spindle
                        fibers during cell division.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cilia and Flagella:</strong> Some animal cells have cilia or flagella, which are
                        hair-like structures used for movement or for moving substances along the surface of the
                        cell.</li>
                </ul>
