                <h2>ii. Cloning</h2>
                <p><b>Definition:</b> Cloning is the process of creating genetically identical copies of an organism,
                    cell, or piece of genetic material. Cloning can be used for both therapeutic and reproductive
                    purposes.</p>

                <h3>Types of Cloning:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Therapeutic Cloning:</b> The creation of genetically identical cells or tissues for medical
                        use, typically to treat diseases or replace damaged tissues. This involves cloning embryos to
                        harvest stem cells.</li>
                    <li><b>Reproductive Cloning:</b> The creation of a genetically identical organism. This involves
                        cloning an entire organism, as in the case of Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cloning Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT):</b> The process used in cloning, where the nucleus of a
                        somatic (body) cell is transferred into an enucleated egg cell (egg cell with its nucleus
                        removed). This triggers the egg to begin dividing and developing into an organism or tissue.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Applications of Cloning:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Agriculture:</b> Cloning livestock with desirable traits (e.g., high milk production, disease
                        resistance).</li>
                    <li><b>Medicine:</b> Potential to create genetically identical tissues for organ transplantation,
                        reducing the risk of organ rejection.</li>
                    <li><b>Conservation:</b> Cloning endangered species to help restore populations.</li>
                    <li><b>Infertility Treatment:</b> Reproductive cloning might be explored in cases of infertility,
                        although it remains controversial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges & Ethical Issues:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cloning Efficiency:</b> The success rate of cloning is low, and many clones suffer from
                        genetic abnormalities.</li>
                    <li><b>Ethical Issues:</b> Reproductive cloning, particularly of humans, raises significant moral
                        and ethical concerns, including questions about identity, autonomy, and the potential for
                        "designer babies."</li>
                    <li><b>Cloning of Humans:</b> Reproductive cloning of humans remains illegal in most countries due
                        to concerns about safety and ethics.</li>
                    <li><b>Genetic Diversity:</b> Cloning reduces genetic diversity, which could make species more
                        vulnerable to disease or environmental changes.</li>
                </ul>
