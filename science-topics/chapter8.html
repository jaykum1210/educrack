                <h2>ii. Waste Management: Overview</h2>
                <p>Waste management involves the collection, transportation, disposal, recycling, or monitoring of waste
                    products to reduce their environmental impact.</p>

                <h3>A. Waste Minimization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</b> A fundamental approach to waste management that focuses on
                        reducing waste generation, reusing items whenever possible, and recycling materials to create
                        new products.</li>
                    <li><b>Eco-Friendly Packaging:</b> Reducing plastic and non-biodegradable materials in packaging,
                        and using sustainable alternatives such as biodegradable or recyclable packaging.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Source Segregation:</b> Dividing waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, and
                        non-recyclable at the source (e.g., homes or businesses) to make processing easier.</li>
                    <li><b>Composting:</b> Organic waste like food scraps and garden waste is composted to create
                        nutrient-rich soil for agriculture and landscaping.</li>
                    <li><b>E-Waste Management:</b> Proper disposal and recycling of electronic waste to recover valuable
                        materials like metals and plastics and prevent hazardous chemicals from leaching into the
                        environment.</li>

                        credits for renewable energy systems or electric vehicles) and effective waste management
                        strategies (e.g., penalties for improper disposal).</li>
                    <li><b>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</b> Laws that hold manufacturers responsible for the
                        entire lifecycle of their products, including the collection and recycling of waste.</li>
